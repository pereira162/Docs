The Architecture toolset (previously referred to as AutoCAD
Architecture®) is now included with AutoCAD® as a specialized toolset.
It is built specifically to create and modify software-based design and
documentation productivity for architects.
Purpose-built architectural design tools help eliminate errors and provide
accurate information to the user, allowing more time for architectural
design. This study details the productivity gains that users may experience
when using AutoCAD with the Architecture toolset rather than just basic
AutoCAD when designing and documenting a building.
Executive summary
Designed by Autodesk and commissioned to an independent consultant,
this study explores common architectural design challenges when
preparing construction documents in basic AutoCAD and the potential
productivity gains by using the Architecture toolset. A set of design
documents were recreated using both basic AutoCAD and AutoCAD with
the Architecture toolset, with tasks ranging from drawing floor plans
and sections to creating details and making revisions. The Architecture
toolset provided a 61% overall productivity gain over the time taken to
accomplish the demonstrated tasks in basic AutoCAD (depending on user
expertise level with the Architecture toolset).

This study explored nine common design challenges and showed direct
comparisons of the time and effort required to accomplish each specific
task in basic AutoCAD versus with the Architecture toolset.*
The same tasks were completed up to 79% faster
using AutoCAD with the Architecture toolset.*
The performance results in this paper were achieved by one user, with
expert-level experience, using both basic AutoCAD and AutoCAD with
the Architecture toolset and conducting comparative tests on the same
sample AutoCAD project of a small one-story village school. The tasks
are comprehensive in nature. The total time it took to complete each task
using both basic AutoCAD and AutoCAD with the Architecture toolset is
documented in each case.
It was assumed during the study that all symbols and title blocks needed
in basic AutoCAD for the design process were local to the document.
Searching time is subjective and the methodologies allowed for the quick
placement of required blocks in the shortest amount of time possible.
A detailed description of the study follows.

Floor plans
When working with basic AutoCAD, a set of
construction documents created by the architect
would begin with the floor plans. Before that process
starts, any styles and symbols that will be used need
to be created and developed: text styles, dimension
styles, standard blocks, etc. This includes building
objects, such as wall styles, doors, windows columns,
beams, and symbols, such as tags, used to identify
rooms and the building objects themselves.
The Architecture toolset includes a huge library of
thousands of predefined building objects added to
tool palettes. These objects can also be customized to
suit the individual project if needed. The task was to
develop floor plans for a simple building project.
Steps
1. Create a ground floor plan
2. Add appropriate walls, doors, and windows as well
as set out internal fixtures (furniture)

Advantages
• The Architecture toolset provides a huge library of architectural
components, including multi-level blocks, which allow for more
productivity when setting up your architectural designs. Regular
AutoCAD blocks can still be used, but the blocks must be moved and
rotated to align with elements such as the structural grid, walls, and
dimension annotation. Inserting multi-view blocks (MvBlocks) from
AutoCAD DesignCenter will also increase productivity if users use
them in their plans. The elevation views will automatically pick the
intelligent views of these blocks.
• The XREF Compare function will also allow for the easier comparison of
existing and new design revisions of structural grids and wall outlines.

Elevations
The task was to create the four primary elevations of the architectural
project: north, south, east, and west. The Architecture toolset provides
you with the facility to create elevations easily and quickly from the 3D
architectural model. In basic AutoCAD, the building plans only existed
as 2D drawings, so any elevations or sections must be created by
projecting lines from the floor plans, like using a drawing board. Any
doors or windows also must be recreated in elevation as new blocks to
be inserted into the elevations and/or sections.
Steps:
• Create project geometry (walls, doors, windows) from floor plans
• Create 2D blocks in elevation (doors and windows)
• Complete elevations and adding annotation where required

Advantages
• The Architecture toolset can save vast amounts of tedious 2D editing
time that would be required in basic AutoCAD. During this task, it
was obvious that building the 3D model with the Architecture toolset
would be far more beneficial than trying to create the project from
2D due to the automatic generation of both elevations and sections
with the Architecture toolset.
• The Architecture toolset also provides great cataloging tools that
allow you to ensure that all fixtures, such as doors and windows,
use the appropriate materials as all this information is already
associated with them when you bring them from the library into the
project. Inserting multi-view blocks (MvBlocks) from DesignCenter
will increase productivity if users use them in their plans. The
elevation views will automatically pick the intelligent views of these
blocks, which can then be brought into the elevations.

Reflected ceiling plans
The task was to generate an arrangement of ceiling grids and light
fixtures in the reflected ceiling plan for the project. To do this in basic
AutoCAD, the floor plans were copied and layers that would not be
needed were either frozen or turned off. A new hatch pattern was then
used to represent the ceiling tiles with the perimeter of the ceiling (and
any subsequent partitions) outlined with the polyline command.
The light fittings and fixtures were created with dynamic blocks and
added to a new tool palette, with the drag-and-drop method being used
to add them to the ceiling plan.
The Architecture toolset allows you to create rooms and spaces from
the 3D model, automatically creating outlines for rooms which also
allows for automatic creation of ceiling grids. The Architecture toolset’s
extensive content library provided pre-drawn light fixtures, which
could be dragged and dropped into the ceiling grids from AutoCAD
DesignCenter with no further editing required.
Steps:
• Draw the ground floor ceiling plan
• Create and add lighting fixtures to the ceiling plan

Advantages
The Architecture toolset provides the following
advantages:
• Automatically generates ceiling grids from existing
room and space outlines
• Features an extensive content library of pre-drawn
lighting fixture blocks
• Automatically inserts lighting fixtures from
DesignCenter with no further editing required
• Avoids costly errors

Building sections
Building sections are an important part of construction documentation. The
Architecture toolset can create building sections using the 3D model in the
same way sections were created in Task 2.
Like in Task 2, the building plans only existed as 2D drawings in basic
AutoCAD, so any building sections must be created by projecting lines from
the floor plans, like using a drawing board. In this case though, any doors
or windows had already been created as blocks to be inserted into the
elevations and could be used in the sections.
Steps:
• Create project geometry (walls, doors, windows) from floor plans
• Create additional 2D blocks in section (doors, windows, and walls
where applicable)
• Complete sections and add annotation where required

Advantages
The Architecture toolset offers huge time savings
here because:
• Building sections can be created automatically with
similar tools to those used for elevations
• Section marks can be straight or staggered
• Building sections (and elevations) can be refreshed
should their positioning in the model change

Sheet layouts
The Architecture toolset offers the same sheet set functionality that basic
AutoCAD does, so the preparation of sheet layouts for the project in both
applications was similar. Once the sheets were generated, files could be
dragged and dropped to create viewports of individual project elements such
as floor plans, elevations, and sections.
Steps:
• Create sheet set for the project
• Create a project cover sheet with a perspective view of the project
• Create sheets for floor plans, ceiling plans, elevations, and sections
• Place appropriate views on sheets
• Create page setups for plotting and printing

sheet views, especially the perspective view on the cover sheet
• Any subsequent changes to the sheets can be refreshed and require
no re-drafting
• Additional sheet set tools provide productivity gains, saving time on
sheet set creation

Details
Architectural construction projects, by their nature, contain many sheets of
large-scale details. Often, a single ‘typical’ details sheet is created, rather
than numerous time-consuming sheets of every individual detail in the proj-
ect. This task comprised of creating two wall details: corner and section.
Steps:
• Create an enlarged plan view from which to take the detail views
• Create detail views from the enlarged plan view
• Add detail components to detail and enhance detail views
• Add appropriate view annotation on detail sheets

(Figures shown in minutes and seconds)
Advantages
Creating sections with basic AutoCAD is a time-consuming
task, especially in 2D drawings. The Architecture toolset
provides substantial time savings, primarily due to the
3D model and pre-designed multi-level blocks in the
content library.
• Details are created from 3D model sections where
the drawing information is already in place
• Blocks from the content library provide all the
necessary graphical information for the details
• The block libraries in the Blocks palette can also be
utilized in the Architecture toolset to centralize blocks
in the cloud
• Detail components can be added to enhance the
detail views

Schedules
All construction projects need schedules. This accounts for the necessary
building elements, such as windows, doors, and other associated fixtures.
Schedules provide the necessary information to cost and catalog a project.
Manufacturer, size, description, and item cost can be included.
Basic AutoCAD requires this information in blocks with attributes, and there is
no refresh option should that attribute information change. The Architecture
toolset content library already has a lot of this information contained in the
pre-drawn blocks. If used in the project and changed, a block from the library
will trigger the appropriate schedule in the project to be refreshed to show
the current details.
Steps:
• Add the appropriate tags to windows and doors in a floor plan
• Create a window schedule from the tagged windows
• Add the schedule to the floor plan
• Any updates to the windows will appear on the refreshed schedule

Automatic project
reports
There will always be changes in architectural projects—it is unavoidable.
Typical issues that often come up are changes to the positioning of doors
and windows and the positioning of internal partition walls to accommo-
date the use of the building. In this task, the positioning of some windows
and doors were changed, and the subsequent project drawings and sheets
were updated to follow suit. The basic AutoCAD drawings did not contain any
intelligent objects, so even small changes caused a considerable amount of
manual rework. Moving walls, doors, or windows meant adjoining lines must
be redrawn.
In the Architecture toolset, intelligent objects maintained their relationships
and design changes could be implemented quickly and easily with updates
also automatically reflected in elevations, sections, and details.
Steps:
• Reposition/change doors and windows in floor plans
• Update drawings and sheets accordingly

Coordination and
publishing
The coordination and publishing of an architectural project can be very
time-consuming. Architects must ensure that the completed drawings go out
on time, that all callouts refer to the proper drawings on the correct sheets,
and so on. Then, the drawings go out for production and even the smallest
error can be costly.
This task involved implementing some minor modifications to the project
drawings, adding additional callouts, and linking them to the appropriate
views on the sheets. The project was then published from the available sheet
set created.
Steps:
• Add callouts, corrections, and additions to the project drawings
• Publish the project using the sheet set available

other publishing tools built-in, which speeds up the publishing
process. To save time, the drawings were published as DWF files, a
medium developed by Autodesk as a portable document format.
• The DWF files published from the Architecture toolset also contained
all the necessary callouts required to link to the elevations, sections,
and details in the project, making it easy for the recipient of the files
to locate referenced views by clicking on the appropriate callouts.

The advantages of the Architecture toolset
Based on these nine selected tasks, the Architecture toolset provides a level
of productivity for architects that is not possible with general-purpose CAD
applications such as basic AutoCAD. Because the Architecture toolset is
built specifically for architectural design, you could realize immediate and
substantial productivity benefits such as the ones discussed in this paper.
