This study details the productivity gains that users may experience\nwhen using AutoCAD with the Architecture toolset rather than just basic\nAutoCAD when designing and documenting a building.\nExecutive summary\nDesigned by Autodesk and commissioned to an independent consultant,\nthis study explores common architectural design challenges when\npreparing construction documents in basic AutoCAD and the potential\nproductivity gains by using the Architecture toolset. A set of design\ndocuments were recreated using both basic AutoCAD and AutoCAD with\nthe Architecture toolset, with tasks ranging from drawing floor plans\nand sections to creating details and making revisions. The Architecture\ntoolset provided a 61% overall productivity gain over the time taken to\naccomplish the demonstrated tasks in basic AutoCAD (depending on user\nexpertise level with the Architecture toolset).\nThe benefits of using the Architecture toolset in AutoCAD 2",

The tasks\nare comprehensive in nature. The total time it took to complete each task\nusing both basic AutoCAD and AutoCAD with the Architecture toolset is\ndocumented in each case.\nIt was assumed during the study that all symbols and title blocks needed\nin basic AutoCAD for the design process were local to the document.\nSearching time is subjective and the methodologies allowed for the quick\nplacement of required blocks in the shortest amount of time possible.\nA detailed description of the study follows.\nThe benefits of using the Architecture toolset in AutoCAD 44",

During this task, it\nwas obvious that building the 3D model with the Architecture toolset\nwould be far more beneficial than trying to create the project from\n2D due to the automatic generation of both elevations and sections\nwith the Architecture toolset.\n• The Architecture toolset also provides great cataloging tools that\nallow you to ensure that all fixtures, such as doors and windows,\nuse the appropriate materials as all this information is already\nassociated with them when you bring them from the library into the\nproject. Inserting multi-view blocks (MvBlocks) from DesignCenter\nwill increase productivity if users use them in their plans. The\nelevation views will automatically pick the intelligent views of these\nblocks, which can then be brought into the elevations.\nTThhee bbeenneeffiittss ooff uussiinngg tthhee AArrcchhiitteeccttuurree ttoooollsseett iinn AAuuttooCCAADD 88",
