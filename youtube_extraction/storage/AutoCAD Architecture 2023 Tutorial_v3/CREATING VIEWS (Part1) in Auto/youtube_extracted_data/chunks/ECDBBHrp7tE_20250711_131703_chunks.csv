you know just answer christine when i
say a word make up yourself
that's it alright so let's talk about
views
all right now views are very important
as they are needed to create
working drawings and if you don't know
what working drawings are is the"
2,"s they are needed to create
working drawings and if you don't know
what working drawings are is the same
thing as blueprint so you know the
blueprinting
it's same one and we all know that the
blueprint is what
we use to construct the building without
the blueprint you cannot
construct the building so it is it is in
the same way without the views
we cannot have the blueprint so we need
to create our
views and views are easy to understand
it's really
looking at the object from uh different

views and views are easy to understand
it's really
looking at the object from uh different
angles
so we want to look at the side we want
to look at the
top the front the back we want to look
at
the inside we want to have various views
to represent
as much uh detail as possible so that
when they are ready to
build the structure they would have
enough information
all right so in this video today we're
going to be creating uh these views
let's see where it goes from there you
know what i mean let"
4,"e're
going to be creating uh these views
let's see where it goes from there you
know what i mean let's get it
so we have completed our drawing we did
our fixtures foundation we should have a
drainage construct
and uh columns uh our stiffness we would
want to create those two
as well which i will be doing in the
near future but i want to go ahead and
show you how to create views
so you can start working on those all
right so under your views tab you want
to make sure
that you organize your views"
5,"rking on those all
right so under your views tab you want
to make sure
that you organize your views properly
because you don't want to get them all
mixed up and become confused over time
all right so in here we have the ability
to create
more folders and to structure everything
so i'm going to be putting all our views
in
three different categories our folders
which would be architecture details
and sections and elevations all right
so as you can see on the left side of
the screen that's how we'r"
6,"d sections and elevations all right
so as you can see on the left side of
the screen that's how we're gonna lay
out
um our views and also when we go to
sheets we're gonna kind of do the same
thing so let's go ahead and we're gonna
create some folders all right so by
clicking on new category that's how we
do it so
i'm going to call this one architect
here right click on views again and say
category call this one uh
section and elevation
i'm putting all sections and elevations
within this folder a"
7,"call this one uh
section and elevation
i'm putting all sections and elevations
within this folder and then i'm going to
create another one and call this
details i'm going to drop all the
details in this
folder and of course you can create as
many you can break them out
for some persons they would want to put
different
trades in different folders so you would
have an electrical
folder you would have a plumbing hvac
so on and so forth for a larger project
but for this tiny little building i'm
goi"
8,"ve a plumbing hvac
so on and so forth for a larger project
but for this tiny little building i'm
going to just drop
all the electrical and plum drainage and
everything inside of that
i'm going to drop our sections here and
our details
here so now that we have all three
categories what i'm going to do is to
create some views within our
architectural folder so let's go ahead
and right click on
this and we're gonna say new drawing now
we could break architectural down into
more categories by creati"
9,"and we're gonna say new drawing now
we could break architectural down into
more categories by creating
more sub folders but we're not gonna do
that we're gonna just go straight into
the drawings and we're going to create a
general drawing and the first one we're
going to do is called the
3d view that's usually the first view
you want to uh
you want to create so that you can see
what the building looks like in 3d so we
click
on the next and of course we want to
include both levels
we want to see"
10,"ooks like in 3d so we
click
on the next and of course we want to
include both levels
we want to see everything and we hit
next and
we also want to see all of these
constructs
and then we're going to hit finish
so as you can see that drawing our view
has been created
inside of our architectural folder so
let's go ahead and open that
up and right down here we can see that
we have
um this dr this view and if we should
rotate it in
three dimensional you can see that it
now has
everything inside of i"
11,"w and if we should
rotate it in
three dimensional you can see that it
now has
everything inside of it all right
so what is happening here is that we
pulled all
of our constructs into one
drawing into a view so that we can
see them all together so
let's go over to our external reference
panel now if you're not seeing this just
type the command
x ref and that should bring it up and
now you can see all
three uh constructs being displayed here
so if i should click on fixtures you can
see the fixture"
12,"ll
three uh constructs being displayed here
so if i should click on fixtures you can
see the fixtures being highlighted
there if i click on foundation you can
see that the foundation is being
highlighted there
and also the ground floor and we could
add more
and more all right later on we will be
adding
the property boundary or the site plan
to this view as well all right so go
around
and play with it let's take a a nicer
look at it and see what we have
so you can see that the foundation has
been"
13,"it let's take a a nicer
look at it and see what we have
so you can see that the foundation has
been added the fixtures are inside
everything is where it is supposed to be
all right so i'm going to leave that
right there and i'm going to hit the
save button
so we have our 3d view and
now we're going to go ahead and create
our other views
so the next view that we're going to
create underneath the architectural
um folder is another general one
and we're gonna call this one uh site
plan i'm gonna h"
14,"rchitectural
um folder is another general one
and we're gonna call this one uh site
plan i'm gonna hit next and of course we
only want to see the ground
floor inside of this one and we do not
want to see
fixtures so i'm gonna uncheck that and
i'm gonna say finish
so i'm gonna just go ahead and create
all the views and then in
in the next video we will start to
detail each view
one by one so again we're gonna go ahead
and create a new drawing general
we're gonna call this one floor
plan next we o"
15,"we're gonna go ahead
and create a new drawing general
we're gonna call this one floor
plan next we only want to see the ground
floor
next we want to see both fixtures and
the ground floor
so finish we have that view being
created and you just keep going
create all the views that you want to
see so let's do foundation
foundation plan now of course this time
we do not want to see the ground floor
we only want to see
the foundation all right so we go ahead
now we select that we hit next
this is the"
16,"only want to see
the foundation all right so we go ahead
now we select that we hit next
this is the only construct for
foundation we'll go ahead and we select
and we'll say next
that has been created and of course
we're going to
keep going um this time
we need a roof framing
plan and we're going to hit next of
course guys you can add a description if
you want i'm
going to hit next we only want to see
the ground floor
next do we want to see fixtures no
finish
that's a real framing plan we're goi"
17,"see
the ground floor
next do we want to see fixtures no
finish
that's a real framing plan we're going
to create a new drawing
and we're going to call this drainage
and
electrical all right so usually we do
drainage and electrical on one drawing
in jamaica except if it is a very big
house
or a large building we just throw it all
on one drawing because especially for
something this small it's
it's not going to be significant so
we're going to hit next
and of course we want to see the ground
floor"
18,"not going to be significant so
we're going to hit next
and of course we want to see the ground
floor here we're going to hit
next we want to see both fixtures and
ground floor
and so that's about all the plans and uh
views that we want underneath our
architectural folder
so that's that i'm gonna now create some
sectional views
in order to create a section of views
i'm going to actually open up my floor
plan
all right so the floor plan is where i
want to see
the arrows and everything so in the
fl"
19,"floor
plan
all right so the floor plan is where i
want to see
the arrows and everything so in the
floor plan here i want to have the
elevation
arrows pointing in towards the building
and i also want to have the sectional
cutting planes showing on this drawing
so that is why we open up this drawing
here to create
our sectional views so i'm gonna
minimize that and the first thing you
want to do
is to change your scale to quarter inch
and quarter inch is the same as 1 in 50
if you're doing
millimet"
20,"o change your scale to quarter inch
and quarter inch is the same as 1 in 50
if you're doing
millimeters so you want to make sure
that you change the scale
because now we are going to be adding
annotative
objects if you don't know what i'm
talking about i have
a video that explains this very well so
go ahead and
watch that video so when you're adding
annotation objects you want to make sure
that you set your scale
so that they will appear at the correct
size all right you don't want it to be
too"
21,"u set your scale
so that they will appear at the correct
size all right you don't want it to be
too big and you don't want it to be too
small
we want it to be perfect all right after
we've done that what we're going to do
is to go ahead and go over to our
annotate
tab and we're going to go across to
callouts
all right so underneath here we see
something called elevations
all right so we're going to select our
elevation drop down and you can see that
we have
various types of elevation here
all ri"
22,"o select our
elevation drop down and you can see that
we have
various types of elevation here
all right you have the interior ones and
we also have the
exterior one and we also have the single
elevation ones all right most times are
for some persons if you're not seeing
the
four arrow one you would have to use the
single
one but with the four arrow one it makes
life very easy so what you do is you
click on it like that
and then we would know just draw a box
around
this building and you want to k"
23,"click on it like that
and then we would know just draw a box
around
this building and you want to kind of
make it look a lit at least a little bit
equal on all sides
so that all the arrows can be somewhat
the same distance away from the building
so
someone look like that and we're gonna
click and so we have this little box
popping up now and we need to do
something here
so we can rename our elevations instead
of calling them
north south east and west for north it
would be the back
because that"
24,"tions instead
of calling them
north south east and west for north it
would be the back
because that would be on this side for
the east
would be the right south would be
front elevation and west would be the
left
elevation all right the next thing we
want to do is to change the scale to
one in quarter because we want these
elevations to be on
this scale the same thing as one in 50.
the same thing that we chose for this
drawing
all right so then now we have the option
to say
do we want to add thes"
25,"hat we chose for this
drawing
all right so then now we have the option
to say
do we want to add these to a new drawing
or in an existing drawing or
in this current drawing that we are now
in
we're going to be placing these
elevations in a new
drawing so go ahead and click on new
drawing
and we're going to name this drawing
elevations
and then we're going to change the
category which is a folder and we want
this to fall
in the in this folder here that we
created earlier
all right so just like tha"
26,"d we want
this to fall
in the in this folder here that we
created earlier
all right so just like that we're going
to hit next and we want to include
both levels next and we want to see
everything all right all our constructs
finish after you hit finish we need to
place
the drawing somewhere do you want to
place it
on this side of the building below the
building over on that side i'm going to
be
placing it somewhere here so let's click
our first point
and then we need to decide how far apart
we w"
27,"acing it somewhere here so let's click
our first point
and then we need to decide how far apart
we want each elevation to be
from each other because you know you
have to space the mode so that you have
enough space to add your dimensions your
labels and all of that
so you need to draw a space it's not you
don't need to
specify just you know determine or
judge or guess as a space
so i'm gonna just probably use that
amount of space
and as you can see it is being generated
now you're not going to s"
28,"probably use that
amount of space
and as you can see it is being generated
now you're not going to see it in this
drawing
because it was created in a new drawing
underneath our
sections folder so if i click this drop
down
we see our new drawing and if i click
this drop down
we see our elevation views before i get
into these
i want to show you know that we now have
our arrows
here and this will appear on our floor
plan
view when we drop it on the sheet that
is why we
do it in this drawing all rig"
29,"ear on our floor
plan
view when we drop it on the sheet that
is why we
do it in this drawing all right so what
i'm going to do now is to open up the
elevation drawing so you can see
what the elevation looks like so here we
are we have the back
we have the right the left and
where's the front oh this will be
different
and it looks um crowdy we did with the
blocks and all of that but
no worry we're gonna fix that and also
we are seeing the foundation
which we should not be seeing but don't
worry w"
