  "full_text": "okay so welcome to episode 12 of our one bedroom house and uh you know we have come a far away and uh today we're gonna just move a little bit further into this project all right so stick around [Music] so i want to say thanks to those of you who have been following all my videos thanks to all my subscribers i really appreciate the support and if it's your first time on the channel thank you for joining and i hope that you like what you're seeing you know and if you do just you know consider subscribing as well consider hitting that like button turn on the notification and guess what that's it just drop a comment below and ask your questions you know just answer christine when i say a word make up yourself that's it alright so let's talk about views all right now views are very important as they are needed to create working drawings and if you don't know what working drawings are is the same thing as blueprint so you know the blueprinting it's same one and we all know that the blueprint is what we use to construct the building without the blueprint you cannot construct the building so it is it is in the same way without the views we cannot have the blueprint so we need to create our views and views are easy to understand it's really looking at the object from uh different angles so we want to look at the side we want to look at the top the front the back we want to look at the inside we want to have various views to represent as much uh detail as possible so that when they are ready to build the structure they would have enough information all right so in this video today we're going to be creating uh these views let's see where it goes from there you know what i mean let's get it so we have completed our drawing we did our fixtures foundation we should have a drainage construct and uh columns uh our stiffness we would want to create those two as well which i will be doing in the near future but i want to go ahead and show you how to create views so you can start working on those all right so under your views tab you want to make sure that you organize your views properly because you don't want to get them all mixed up and become confused over time all right so in here we have the ability to create more folders and to structure everything so i'm going to be putting all our views in three different categories our folders which would be architecture details and sections and elevations all right so as you can see on the left side of the screen that's how we're gonna lay out um our views and also when we go to sheets we're gonna kind of do the same thing so let's go ahead and we're gonna create some folders all right so by clicking on new category that's how we do it so i'm going to call this one architect here right click on views again and say category call this one uh section and elevation i'm putting all sections and elevations within this folder and then i'm going to create another one and call this details i'm going to drop all the details in this folder and of course you can create as many you can break them out for some persons they would want to put different trades in different folders so you would have an electrical folder you would have a plumbing hvac so on and so forth for a larger project but for this tiny little building i'm going to just drop all the electrical and plum drainage and everything inside of that i'm going to drop our sections here and our details here so now that we have all three categories what i'm going to do is to create some views within our architectural folder so let's go ahead and right click on this and we're gonna say new drawing now we could break architectural down into more categories by creating more sub folders but we're not gonna do that we're gonna just go straight into the drawings and we're going to create a general drawing and the first one we're going to do is called the 3d view that's usually the first view you want to uh you want to create so that you can see what the building looks like in 3d so we click on the next and of course we want to include both levels we want to see everything and we hit next and we also want to see all of these constructs and then we're going to hit finish so as you can see that drawing our view has been created inside of our architectural folder so let's go ahead and open that up and right down here we can see that we have um this dr this view and if we should rotate it in three dimensional you can see that it now has everything inside of it all right so what is happening here is that we pulled all of our constructs into one drawing into a view so that we can see them all together so let's go over to our external reference panel now if you're not seeing this just type the command x ref and that should bring it up and now you can see all three uh constructs being displayed here so if i should click on fixtures you can see the fixtures being highlighted there if i click on foundation you can see that the foundation is being highlighted there and also the ground floor and we could add more and more all right later on we will be adding the property boundary or the site plan to this view as well all right so go around and play with it let's take a a nicer look at it and see what we have so you can see that the foundation has been added the fixtures are inside everything is where it is supposed to be all right so i'm going to leave that right there and i'm going to hit the save button so we have our 3d view and now we're going to go ahead and create our other views so the next view that we're going to create underneath the architectural um folder is another general one and we're gonna call this one uh site plan i'm gonna hit next and of course we only want to see the ground floor inside of this one and we do not want to see fixtures so i'm gonna uncheck that and i'm gonna say finish so i'm gonna just go ahead and create all the views and then in in the next video we will start to detail each view one by one so again we're gonna go ahead and create a new drawing general we're gonna call this one floor plan next we only want to see the ground floor next we want to see both fixtures and the ground floor so finish we have that view being created and you just keep going create all the views that you want to see so let's do foundation foundation plan now of course this time we do not want to see the ground floor we only want to see the foundation all right so we go ahead now we select that we hit next this is the only construct for foundation we'll go ahead and we select and we'll say next that has been created and of course we're going to keep going um this time we need a roof framing plan and we're going to hit next of course guys you can add a description if you want i'm going to hit next we only want to see the ground floor next do we want to see fixtures no finish that's a real framing plan we're going to create a new drawing and we're going to call this drainage and electrical all right so usually we do drainage and electrical on one drawing in jamaica except if it is a very big house or a large building we just throw it all on one drawing because especially for something this small it's it's not going to be significant so we're going to hit next and of course we want to see the ground floor here we're going to hit next we want to see both fixtures and ground floor and so that's about all the plans and uh views that we want underneath our architectural folder so that's that i'm gonna now create some sectional views in order to create a section of views i'm going to actually open up my floor plan all right so the floor plan is where i want to see the arrows and everything so in the floor plan here i want to have the elevation arrows pointing in towards the building and i also want to have the sectional cutting planes showing on this drawing so that is why we open up this drawing here to create our sectional views so i'm gonna minimize that and the first thing you want to do is to change your scale to quarter inch and quarter inch is the same as 1 in 50 if you're doing millimeters so you want to make sure that you change the scale because now we are going to be adding annotative objects if you don't know what i'm talking about i have a video that explains this very well so go ahead and watch that video so when you're adding annotation objects you want to make sure that you set your scale so that they will appear at the correct size all right you don't want it to be too big and you don't want it to be too small we want it to be perfect all right after we've done that what we're going to do is to go ahead and go over to our annotate tab and we're going to go across to callouts all right so underneath here we see something called elevations all right so we're going to select our elevation drop down and you can see that we have various types of elevation here all right you have the interior ones and we also have the exterior one and we also have the single elevation ones all right most times are for some persons if you're not seeing the four arrow one you would have to use the single one but with the four arrow one it makes life very easy so what you do is you click on it like that and then we would know just draw a box around this building and you want to kind of make it look a lit at least a little bit equal on all sides so that all the arrows can be somewhat the same distance away from the building so someone look like that and we're gonna click and so we have this little box popping up now and we need to do something here so we can rename our elevations instead of calling them north south east and west for north it would be the back because that would be on this side for the east would be the right south would be front elevation and west would be the left elevation all right the next thing we want to do is to change the scale to one in quarter because we want these elevations to be on this scale the same thing as one in 50. the same thing that we chose for this drawing all right so then now we have the option to say do we want to add these to a new drawing or in an existing drawing or in this current drawing that we are now in we're going to be placing these elevations in a new drawing so go ahead and click on new drawing and we're going to name this drawing elevations and then we're going to change the category which is a folder and we want this to fall in the in this folder here that we created earlier all right so just like that we're going to hit next and we want to include both levels next and we want to see everything all right all our constructs finish after you hit finish we need to place the drawing somewhere do you want to place it on this side of the building below the building over on that side i'm going to be placing it somewhere here so let's click our first point and then we need to decide how far apart we want each elevation to be from each other because you know you have to space the mode so that you have enough space to add your dimensions your labels and all of that so you need to draw a space it's not you don't need to specify just you know determine or judge or guess as a space so i'm gonna just probably use that amount of space and as you can see it is being generated now you're not going to see it in this drawing because it was created in a new drawing underneath our sections folder so if i click this drop down we see our new drawing and if i click this drop down we see our elevation views before i get into these i want to show you know that we now have our arrows here and this will appear on our floor plan view when we drop it on the sheet that is why we do it in this drawing all right so what i'm going to do now is to open up the elevation drawing so you can see what the elevation looks like so here we are we have the back we have the right the left and where's the front oh this will be different and it looks um crowdy we did with the blocks and all of that but no worry we're gonna fix that and also we are seeing the foundation which we should not be seeing but don't worry we're gonna fix it that's that i'm gonna x this off and i'm you don't have to say yes it's gonna always be there what we're gonna do now is to create some sectional views and we want to do it on the floor plan view as well all right so remember now we are inside of our floor plan view i don't want you to confuse this floor plan with our construct okay construct is called a ground floor so good two different names so our floor plan is where we're adding these uh markers here so let's go up back to call outs and we're going to go to sections and as you can see we have various options this one is the one that we're going to use so we're going to select it with the two arrows and when we're doing section guys it is important that you cut through the kitchen and the bathroom you have to cut through the kitchen and the bathroom it is a requirement by the municipal cooperation cooperation so um you have to cut through both areas and you must have at least two sectional views okay so one is not gonna do it you need to cut this way and you need to cut this way for larger buildings they will request more okay so but the minimum is two so we're going to create one running across this building cutting right through here both kitchen and the bathroom looking towards the back and then the second one will be cutting through the kitchen looking towards the left so let's do the first one so we're going to start somewhere about here and as you can see my line is not a guaranteed a straight line if i do it like this so i need to turn on the author mode so that i can get a perfectly straight line so i'm going to draw it all the way out close to the elevation arrow click we hit enter and then now we have the option to choose which direction do you want the arrows to point up or down in this case we want it to point up and we want to pull this box here all the way out like that because if we only pull it halfway like this only what is inside of the box will show in the elevation view so we need to pull it all the way back so that we can see everything uh in this direction so let's click and of course this box comes back up we need to name the section i'm going to call it section a and i'm going to create a new drawing of course set your scale and we're going to say new drawing i'm going to call this sectional elevations and we're gonna drop it inside of the sections folder just like we did with elevations all right hit next and we want to see both levels next and we want to see everything again we want to see all of these and we're going to hit finish again after you hit finish you need to place the drawing somewhere so i'm going to be placing this one right here so if i go to the navigator and we click our drop down we can see that we have sectional elevations and if we drop this down we have our first section so we're going to create our second one which should be running pretty close to the stove right here so let's click on that again and we're going to draw one from let's say here that's too close to the wall i mean it can be close to the wall but what's gonna happen it's gonna cut through the foundation below and i don't want that so i want to cut it like here maybe here yeah it's not too bad all right bring it down click hit enter and now we decide which direction i want to see everything in this direction so i'm going to click there and then of course this would be section b set my scale and now we're going to be placing it in an existing drawing we want to put it in the same drawing that we put our first section so we're going to say existing and we would go ahead and select our previous drawing we hit ok and this was section a i'm going to place section b right beside it right there so now you can see that we have all our elevations and both our sections so let's open up this drawing and see what it looks like good so here we can see that we have both sections all right from here and here we can see inside the building and this that's good this is exactly what we want to see all right so i'm going to x this off as a matter of fact i'm going to remain in this drawing because the other views that i'm going to be creating will be coming from this particular drawing so i want to do a detail of the foundation all right so we're moving on to details and the first details i'm going to do is the foundation footing so i want to create a call out bubble right here for this detail so what we're going to do is to go back to call out and we're going to go down to this drop down here where it says detail all right we can select circle rectangle or we can draw our own shape but for this one i'm going to use rectangle and i'm going to just draw a rectangle right around this foundation footing right like that so you can see that it creates this uh call out bubble right here and i'm going to drop the the head right here hit enter and we're going to call this foundation footing detail we're going to say all right we want it at a half inch scale half inch scale is a regular scale for detailed views so of course we're gonna leave it there if you want it to be much bigger than half inch you would go ahead and select maybe three quarters or one inch or one and a half inch but half inch is good enough for this uh we want to create a new drawing all right so create a new right and we're going to call this details and we're going to of course drop it in the details folder we're going to hit next we want to see both ground floor and foundation we're gonna hit next and what i do not want to see here are the fixtures so remove that and we're gonna hit finish and then of course the last thing we need to do is to place the details where we want it so i'm going to place it just below this view click it right there all right so that's our first uh detail i'm gonna do one for the eve and i'm gonna bring it all the way down so i can capture this air where the lintel is and also the ring beam so all of that will be captured within this one detail so i'm gonna do another one call it that rectangle and i'm gonna capture everything from here all the way up to about here so all right i'm going to put the other bubble right here and hit enter i'm going to call this eve ring or belt beam and lintel i'm going to just add it all in one you could actually break them apart if you want that's fine i'm going to say half inch and this time i'm going to place it in an existing drawing so we're going to say existing it's not valid all right let's remove the commas [Music] existing drawing and we want to place it in the detail view all right so we're gonna say okay and of course our first view was right here but i'm gonna place this one just beside it maybe maybe right there and so we have two views so far the last view i'm going to create is for the ridge detail so let's go ahead and do one more of that i'm going to draw it right here and i'm going to put the bubble right there and hit enter i'm going to call this ridge detail and i'm gonna say half inch is good i'm gonna place it in an existing drawing the details drawing okay and then i'm gonna be placing it right beside these two probably like right there and you can go ahead and create as much detail as you want so if you need to show these in some more details if you had some like staircase or stairwell or whatever the case might be you can add as many details as you would like if there is a detail on here that you're not seeing and you want to represent it um from the floor plan what you would do is to use a a a sectional detail line all right so if i wanted to show let's say i wanted to cut through this drain hole to show what's happening in that hole right there i would use um one of these cutting lines to show what's happening there all right so that's what you would do for views that you're not seeing from these sectional views but i'm going to leave that right there what i'm going to do now is to open up our details view so here are the three details that we just created so i'm going to just open up this drawing and from here you can see that we have all of these three uh drawings showing up right here so all that's left for us to do now is to go through and annotate everything all right so all our views have been created including our elevations or sections or details and all of our floor plans have been created alright guys this is where i'm going to end the video guys so we have created our 3d view which i actually will be dropping the site plan inside of this we have our plan view which has our car loads well our sectional planes and our elevation arrows we have our sectional views with detailed callouts and we also have our details over here all right guys so thank you for joining me i hope that you learned something if you have any questions at all just feel free to drop them in the comments and i'll be sure to answer them all right so see you in the next video promise all right big of yourself respect",
