for joining me on episode number two for one bedroom series all right so if you miss episode number one you need to go back and you need to watch that one so check the description below for that video all right so what we're doing is to draw a one bedroom house from start to finish all right this one in particular that's a pretty simple pretty neat result a rectangle and we're going to roof it up we're gonna try to model as much as we can and yeah we're gonna have dimensions with Anna Jordan the property we're gonna do everything a great thing okay so today's video is about setting up our set up yeah so before you start a project you need to set now this foundation on which all your drawings will be upon but before you start to set up you need to figure out which unit of measurement you're gonna use and in order to do that you need to know what unit is acceptable in the country that area in Jamaica we use the metric system so we have the imperial system and we have the metric system so if you don't know what these are this is what they look like okay so that imperial system are the standard system deals with feet and inches while the metric system deals with millimeters meters kilometres that kind of stuff the imperial system is represented in fractions while the metric system is represented decimals Jamaica in this case requires millimeters I personally prefer to use the imperial system look I prefer fractions or decimals in this case for some reason I just think it's easier for me to understand 12-feet is easier to remember than three thousand five hundred and twenty nine millimeters so we will be doing this project in feet and inches however there is a way that you can use the program to show both dimensions so that it is no acceptable bypass constant you get alright so that's the first thing you need once you have decided then we can know the set of our project on that system whichever one you choose to use the same principles apply I just needed to explain that now we're going to move over to other kind of where you need to understand what's happening and how to go about setting up your project all right let's go alright so here we are on the computer so I have both units of measurement on my install on my computer I have imperial and I have metric so whichever one you're gonna use we're going to use well I'm gonna use imperial for this project so if you're gonna use metric of course you would want to select that one now if you're not seeing one on your screen then what you can do is just follow what I'm doing here so we're good to go to control panel and we will go to programs and features right here and look for autocad architecture and then we're gonna say change all right all right so what we're looking at here is that is the installer for autocad architecture you should be familiar with this screen when you were installing the software all right so what we're going to click on is this one over here add our more features and that will bring up this option so as you can see I have both units selected all right no that is the reason why you can see that I have both here because I already had them both selected here so if you need one or the other you would go ahead and slipped and follow through with the instructions okay so since I already have them both I'll just X this off all right and then once you're done with that then we'll open up autocrat all right so here we are on the AutoCAD dashboard so the first thing we're going to do is to set up our project so let's go ahead look for the project browser icon at the top here it's gonna bring you to what we call the project browser all right now when you're going to open a project or create a new project this is where you would start as I said you would open your project here as well because if you notice this is the folder that they are saved in so we have documents my documents are that's my projects and you can see all your arms will be stored here and if you open this one which is the one that you see over here and you go inside you will see that it has multiple files what happened is that it creates a separate file for each element of your project alright so we would put the first floor on a separate in a separate file we put a ground-floor in a separate file and so on and so forth and I will explain to you why it works like that all right so you want to ensure that you open your project from this browser all right so of course I have this project open now I'm going to close it and we're going to start a new project all right so we click on this button but create a new folder first gonna give our drawing a number so d03 since that's we're at jar number three we're gonna call this one more one bed house all right so that's that open it up there now once we're inside of that folder we're gonna treat a new project so go ahead I'm gonna give our project a number it's important that you give your project a number guys all right so great that in mind of course we're gonna call this one dead room house and you can add a description like one bedroom dwelling to be constructed at our in Hut field Manchester Jamaica whatever something needed to put a description if you want you don't have to of course we're not gonna use a template at this time because we didn't create in so I'm gonna say okay now your project has been created so if I should bring this folder back up [Music] now you see that it has been treated here all right so put that away and once you see that it is bold that mean that project is active so we can close all right good so know that that's done what happened now is that list this becomes active and this is called your project navigator now if you're not seeing this what you would do is click on it up here so you'd find it up here click on it you get it back alright so now we're in actually inside of our one bedroom house project juror number three description all right so now this is where you're gonna set up your project all right and the project Navigator is the is responsible for combining all your files this is where all your files are kept in an organized fashion all right so you would have project settings here you would do your drawings in here you would create your views and then finally you would create your sheets and everything would be in an organized fashion right here alright so first thing we need to do is to setup a project so we go click on this edit project button alright that's already there that's already there that good we're gonna change these to guess yes and then we're gonna find some templates so being that we're gonna use Imperial we're gonna select CTV alright go ahead Imperial CTB open and we're gonna do the same thing for sheet templates we're gonna say go down to sheet imperial CTV open and then you would select the size sheet that you want to use on this project so we're gonna use 24 by 36 which is too big for a tiny one-bedroom house but this would be like a regular sheet size that we would use in Jamaica all right especially for a residential project alright good so then we would apply and then we would say ok and of course we would say yes make sure you read through these stuff before you click all right good so now that your project is zipped we can no need to sit or levels all right so I want to explain to you what levels are before we move on now I have this little drawing here and I have a ruler of course I was a teacher so I understand how to point with ruler so yeah so what I have here is a television and I want to explain what levels are all right so a building can be broken down into levels all right and it levels simply mean if you have multi-story buildings you would have level one which would be the lowest floor and then level two level three level floor number four as you go up all right now this project is just a one bedroom really actually we don't need to break it up in levels but I want to do something for demonstration purpose so what we're gonna do is to put the foundation what is below the ground on a separate level and then we're going to put everything above which would be the the first floor itself or the ground floor on a level four itself so what's gonna happen is that we're gonna put so we're gonna call the finished floor level the finished floor level we're gonna call it the zero line so this is the zero line now we're gonna make the foundation four feet below all right so let's say the foundation is going to look something like this so we're gonna make the foundation four feet below the zero line below the finish for a level and then we're gonna make the wall everything above from the finished floor level to the wall plate we're gonna make that ten feet all right so bear that in mind when we are gonna create our levels all right so let's look at that how do we set that up on the computer so go ahead and click on the levels setting and the first in one enter is is the foundation I want to start from butter all right so we're gonna name this one over this level foundation [Music] howdy-doo you why it's gonna be four feet below zero which would make it minus four okay so this would nomicon minus four feet so let's do that - four feet all right and then here you'll put in how tall do you want the foundation of course if it is minus four feet below that's where I wanted to start it's gonna be four feet high so four feet high am I gonna put in an ID for F I'm gonna put in my description foundati all right then we're gonna make sure that this is selected okay and you create a new level what happened now because this was selected the new level will now are to adjust elevation so now our level our first level now which would be ground level this now starts at the zero mark as you can see here but now we want to be 10 feet that's 10 inch 10 feet high enter and then we would call this level 1 it has an IB let's get let's name it actually we're on floor I'm gonna call this floor so we have the we have our lentils we have Foundation which which is four feet below that's where it's gonna start and we have lower ground floor which is going to be starting at zero mark all right guys so that's how we're gonna do that all right and you can always come back and change these and of course if you had more levels you would continue to create more level so let's say for instance we had a second floor or we had an upper floor it would now begin at ten feet level and we would want it to be another ten feet high and that would have an ID of two and of course we would give it a description but we're not gonna need this so let's remove that and then we're gonna say okay yes so now you can see that it's being populated here all right and please check the zero and these measurements here to make sure that they're in Imperial or metric whichever system that you're using alright so moving down the list we have what is called divisions all right no divisions again for a small project like this you don't need divisions but I'm gonna be using it for demonstration purpose all right so divisions is really if you were to break up a building into sections let's say you have the West Wing the East Wing and the north wing and so on and so forth if you had let's say a garage that is being attached to the house or if you have an accessory building somewhere else you would add divisions to your project so we're gonna add one all right we're gonna call it the main building and what I did should I give it description mean Billy enter stupid em hi okay so we have a division all right so everything here is set up we're good to go let's go down to construct no this is where you would now start to draw alright so we're gonna create the different files that we need to draw inside of so we need to create some construct so we're gonna write right-click on that new I was a new construct so we're gonna give this a name the first drawing we would want to do would be our or let's say we create a file for the foundation all right you can give it a description I'm not gonna give it any and here you would see the divisions so of course the foundation that we're going to be drawing will be for the main building and we're joined foundation so we'll check that of course if you were gonna do foundation for let's say a garage which would have its own division or accessor building which would have its own division you would not check this one you would go and check the one that corresponds with you get the idea alright so we're doing the foundation you don't worry we're not gonna open the drawing all right that is being created and then we're gonna create another one now for ground floor so we're go ahead and select ground-floor okay all right no I'm gonna open this one so you can see what happens and so what happened is that it opens up the ground floor drawing so now I can go ahead and draw my ground floor here now if I want to draw a foundation the foundation I would go into foundation and draw the foundation in destroy and it's in two separate drawings okay later when we're gonna create our views we will be able to combine them to get one entire drawing but the idea here is to draw our components are all levels on a separate drawing so that it relieves the pressure on the computer all right you don't have too many stuff working with that you don't really need that that moment in time all right so that is the reason for that all right so we have both our constructs created we're gonna create some elements and elements are stuff reference material so let's see gridlines if you were to use gridlines property boundary that kind of thing so for this project I want to you know try some grid lines even though it's very tiny but just to show you how to get that done so let's create one call it grid lines and that's that so that's that's all we're going to do for that I might create another one and call it a property boundary all right so you create each of these in their separate files so in the next video we will be exploring our ground floor okay this is our next step but before we draw the ground floor we want to lay out our grid lights of course the grid line is totally unnecessary for this project but I'm gonna do it for demonstration purpose okay so that's how you go about setting up your project eyes so thank you for joining me I hope that you learn something if you have any question at all let's drop them in the comments below and of course I'll try to answer as much as I can and look out for the next video so see you guys big up [Music]",
