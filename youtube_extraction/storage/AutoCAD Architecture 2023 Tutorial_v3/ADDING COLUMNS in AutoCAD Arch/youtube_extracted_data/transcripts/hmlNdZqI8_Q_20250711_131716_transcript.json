  "full_text": "hello everyone this is episode 13 of our one bedroom house and uh today what we're gonna do is to add some columns to our building all right but before we get into that i want to say thank you to all my visionaries who have been supporting the channel so far um you know big open self respect and if it's your first time on the channel thank you for joining if you like what you see here or if you learned something you know what hit the like button and also don't forget to subscribe and comment and everything also follow me on my other social media platforms instagram twitter those are the only two i have right now and uh yeah let's jump on the other side let's go [Music] all right so you know how it goes over here classroom style the first question the teacher is going to ask you is what is a column anybody here know what is a column raise your hand for me you know what let's turn to google i ask google what is a column an upright pillar typically cylindrical and made of stone or concrete supporting an entablature arch or other structure or standing alone as a monument what google is basically telling us is that a column is not only here for pretty looks if you know what i'm saying columns are often load bearing which simply mean that they are holding up something whether it be the roof a beam an arch something most times or sometimes them have it by itself standing up in the middle of nowhere just for pretty looks so columns also come in various shape size and are made from concrete stone steel and even wood most of the columns that are made from wood we typically call those a post but the their function is similar to a column because they are holding up something as well so we just put them in another class there and we'll say yeah what hold on a column so i want to see it right listen somebody said all right okay so before we get into the specific columns that we're going to use on this building it is important to note that the shape size and the material that is used to make these columns are usually determined by an engineer all right someone who understands how load works um how to do calculations and make sure that you're using the right steel the right mix of concrete you know to determine if the size of the column is big enough or wide enough to hold up a certain amount of load or weight so these can be very uh tricky if you don't understand what you're doing but for this building and most buildings that we do in jamaica um we have a standard column type that we use which i'm going to get into in a moment and this is just a typical example all right so if you're going to do a much larger building and so on then you would need to do some more research and find out exactly the type of column and beam also that would be needed for your particular project all right so of course the columns that we're using will be made from concrete they will be reinforced with steel or rebar and so they look like these these are special shaped columns um that we in jamaica call stiffeners right so as you can see we have various shapes and of course they are not limited to these only depends on how the walls connect all right so of course in our drawing we will only need to use these three top ones that you're seeing here so the standard t stiffener we have the eye stiffener and we also have the l stiffener and by just looking at it you can basically determine where on the building you would place these based on the shape of the column so of course the t would go somewhere where the wall meets another wall like that at a junction and then the eye would go on a straight wall so if you have a wall that is very long or if you have a wall that stops in the middle of a room or something you want to use the eye stiffener and also if you have the corner of the building we want to use the l stiffness and in other cases we would use a cross shaped stiffener or a y shape or a 45 degree angle stiffener all right so you can go ahead and download this pdf in the description below because you're going to need it all right as you can see we have the dimensions on here for this particular project and as you can see each leg of the stiffener has the width of the wall so this one is six inches this one is also six and this one over here would be the same as well likewise we have one that is six by twelve and we also have another one so if your wall is going to be eight inches you gonna make sure that uh the thickness of your stiffener is also eight inches all right so that is that let's move over into autocad and we get the thing rolling so the first thing you want to do if you notice here kind of go ahead with things so that i can move a little faster so go ahead and create a construct and call it structural because really actually columns and beams would be placed in this drawing we're not going to model the beams here we could do everything here in 3d but we're going to do them in 2d just to make things easier and also really and truly we don't need 3d for this drawing especially due to the fact that these columns are basically hidden within the walls you won't be seeing them popping out of the wall so we don't necessarily need to put them in 3d all right even for this one in the corner here we already have a column looking thing there if i should put the drawing in 3d you can see that we have something that looks like a column already so we don't need to model anything at all here in 3d so go ahead create a construct and we're going to call it structural as you can see i have it open up already and then you're going to minimize that no before you minimize go ahead and x-ref overlay the ground floor into your structural model arm structural drawing so that's what i have done here so far and then you're going to go ahead and draw the shape of your stiffeners so if you notice i have one that i didn't do which is the t-shape one so i'm going to show you how to go about doing that but i already have uh three already made and these are actually smart as you can see they have a pull point and they also have a rotation uh ability so the one that i'm gonna create i'm gonna show you how i go about doing that so let's go ahead and you would want to look on the pdf to make sure that you're following uh the dimension and the sizing accurately all right so we're going to turn on our author mode and we're going to go ahead and just draw the t stiffness so six six six it's all six all the way almost like the mark of the beast circle and sees trample the beast all right so there we go so this is our thing and then we're going to just type the command the join we're going to join everything together hit enter and we're going to then hatch using the concrete uh hatch which is this make sure that it is saying one do that hit enter so now we have a hatching and we also have the shape of the thing all right at this point we're gonna turn all of this into a block so we're gonna type the command well let's select everything first and then type the command block so what we're doing here is to as you can see that little display there is to turn this object into a block now if you look down here you can see that i have those three made and they are named inside of here so we're going to name this one the standard t stiffener and we're going to hit oh okay we're going to say open in block editor because we want to make it smart so we're gonna say okay all right so now that we're in the editor this is where we can make it into something that we can rotate and and those kind of thing so the first thing we're gonna do is to go up to parameter and we're gonna add a point all right we're going to add two points we want to be able to grab the object from this corner and this corner so let's do that grab i'm going to put one point here i'm going to put another point here let's drag these out these are just labels to identify where your stuff is as you can see the blue marker here is where the actual thing is at and we also want to be able to rotate this block so we're gonna click on rotate we want to rotate it from these two points as well so we're going to place the first one right here we're going to drag this out like so and type it and the angle that we want would be 180 degrees and then we're going to also type 8 once more so as you can see we have our rotation handle right there we want to place another one over here so we're going to click on rotation again and we're going to click in this corner drag this out and type it and our angle would be zero enter and just like that we now have our two rotational uh handles so now guess what we need to make them into actions because even though we place the parameters they are not active so what we're going to do is to do the the move handles first so let's click on move it says here select the parameter so we want to do this one first so we're going to select that and then it is now asking you what do you want to rotate we want to rotate everything hit enter actually it's not rotate it's move let's do this the second one select the parameter what do you want to move everything enter we're going to do the same thing for rotate so click on rotate we're going to do this rotation parameter first so we click on the parameter now we need to select everything that we want to rotate which would be everything hold on let me let me let me zoom out everything enter i'm going to do the next one rotate we're going to select this one what do you want to rotate everything enter and that's it we hit close we hit save and just like that we have a block that can be moved around with these handles let me turn this off so we can move it around and we can also rotate it using any of these handles all right so just like that you want to make sure that you save because that's a lot of work and also go ahead and create a layer for these columns so i've already created one here called s calls and i made it green and also at a line weight of 0.5 mm so go ahead and create that layer and what we're going to do is to place all of these on that layer so everything looks the way it ought all right so usually what i would do now is to start copying these over so we're going to hit the copy tool i usually do this one first because this one kind of fit in all of the corners of the hose all right so i'm going to place that one there i'm going to place one here i'm going to place one here and i'm going to place one here and then i'm going to place one here and of course you're going to go ahead and rotate them now into the orientation if you notice this is not good so we need to turn on author so that we can make them uh perfectly straight you don't want to rotate it and it should be what 90 90 degree rotation and when you check it 89.7 and that kind of thing that's that's miss that's that that wouldn't be good all right you want your thing to be as accurate as possible so go ahead and click on those rotation handle and just rotate your thing so far we have all four or five corners taken care of i'm gonna add a t maybe right there and another t over here so let's go ahead and do that and you could actually rotate it from here before you copy it so that that so that way you can just you know move it over let me turn this off for now i'm gonna drop that one right there i'm gonna need this one right here as well turn my author mode on before i rotate okay obviously that was placed in the wrong spot so let's just drag it up like so all right so we have two t stiffeners i don't think we need any more than that i'm gonna be placing a couple of um eye stiffeners so this one i'm gonna copy and i'm gonna drop this one right here and so i can rotate this one like so right in that spot so i would have a beam running over this into that and then i would have a beam running from this into that beam over here i feel like i needed to have another t stiffener right here i don't think you need it but i'm just gonna put it there right so we have this beam running into that and then this beam running to this wall down here so what i'll do is to put another l right there i'll put a l right here and rotate this all right one other thing you don't want to have too many columns on the building because you'll make the building too rigid and that's not good you want the building to have a some amount of wiggle to it so that it can hold up to the earthquakes and all of that all right so too many columns can actually be a problem like if you have like tiny closets and those things you don't need to be putting columns in all of those areas i think we have enough columns here and then we might need one extra one the square one not to be placed right there so i'm gonna copy this i'm gonna drop it actually i think i've copied it from the wrong spot let me move it from this corner to that corner so now we have all of our columns in place i can go ahead and delete these i don't want to see them if i go to 3d you can see them on the floor and remember that these are in 2d so and so that is how you go about getting in your columns guys and we're going to hit the save button all right one of the other things that we could actually do is go to our views and now we need to add these columns to our floor plan and our foundation plan as well so we go ahead and right click and we say properties i'll go down to content and we make sure that structural is is selected and we say okay now we're going to do the same thing for foundation i'm going to go to properties content okay it's not in our foundation and i think i know why the construct is on the ground floor so i'm gonna go properties here and i'm gonna also select foundation okay good so that way when we go to views and we go to foundation and we say properties and we go to that then we have structural as well so that way now when we open up these views we now see that they're located inside if i should open up my foundation let me keep this up open up foundation we also see them inside of here and this is very important because these columns will be constructed from the foundation up and so we need to be able to see them from this view as well all right guys so that is where we're gonna wrap this up today um thank you for watching thank you for tuning in i hope that you learned something and of course you're not gonna forget i'm gonna remind you to hit the like button hit the subscribe button and also hit the bell and don't forget to comment and share and everything else follow me on instagram follow me on twitter that's it alright so see you in the next video if you have any questions you know what to do already and uh yeah yeah let's let let's get the baller rolling man [Music] you",
