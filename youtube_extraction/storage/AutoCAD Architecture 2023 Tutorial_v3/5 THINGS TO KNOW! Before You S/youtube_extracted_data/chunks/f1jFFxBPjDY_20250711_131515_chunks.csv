0,"hello I want a two-bedroom house I want
a three-bedroom I want a six bedroom
with seven bathroom and a pool hi
everyone thank you for joining me on
another YouTube video it's been a while
a lot of things has been happening and
you know I just didn't have the time but
I really want to do this so I am back at
it and it's all for you guys this has
been a passion in my heart to share what
I know because I know that there are a
lot of persons who would like to learn
at least the basics as I only know"
1,"se I know that there are a
lot of persons who would like to learn
at least the basics as I only know the
basics alright so thank you for joining
me on this video so in today's video
I'll be teaching you my method of
drawing a house from start to finish
print and ready to submit the project so
for those of you who don't know what
freshman is parish council is is the
second tier of government in Jamaica
well cuz I'm from Jamaica of course yeah
I don't know if it's the same thing in
other Caribbean"
2,"aica
well cuz I'm from Jamaica of course yeah
I don't know if it's the same thing in
other Caribbean countries but in Jamaica
the parents deals with local affairs
alright so in each price you have a
local government that regulates that
parish so they would be the ones that
you would would approve a design before
you can actually go and build it all
right
that being said before you can do any
design at all
mean to consider a couple of things
actually a lot of things but I'll just
shorten the list"
3,"n at all
mean to consider a couple of things
actually a lot of things but I'll just
shorten the list to the minimum and
these are some very important stuff at
least things that I would require when a
client comes to me and want me to do a
project for them these are a couple of
things that I need in order to start a
design alright so the first one would be
get the diagram of the property are the
land
you need the diagram alright that's what
that's like that's a must
where can you find this it is"
4,"nd
you need the diagram alright that's what
that's like that's a must
where can you find this it is located on
the surveillance reporting so this is
what the surveyors report should look
like in Jamaica and this is something
that your client should provide you with
it has the shape of the land exact
precise dimensions and it tells you
where the road is it tells you your
neighboring properties it tells you the
coordinates of property and it also
gives you the north alright so this is
very importa"
5,"ells you the
coordinates of property and it also
gives you the north alright so this is
very important because you don't want to
design something that after you're done
everything it cannot fit on the land is
it probably too big or might be too
small you could have made better use of
the space that you are given alright
this is actually a very good good shape
has some property actually shape of
triangular shape some of them looks
curved all right so it's very important
that you bear that in mind"
6,"iangular shape some of them looks
curved all right so it's very important
that you bear that in mind as you can
see over this side there are some
coordinates you can actually use these
coordinates to draw the property in CAD
to its exact dimensions because these
were provided by the surveyor all right
so I'll be doing a separate video on how
to do that or how I go about doing
the second thing no your setbacks and
zoning regulations these are important
you can get these from your parish
council so a local da may call them up
ask them what are the setbacks in say
