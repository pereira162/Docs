0,"hi so this is episode 9 of our
one-bedroom house series and today we're
gonna start working on our roof plan
design so if you notice in each episode
as we progress on this project things
start to get a little bit more technical
and guess what this video is not an
exception so you're gonna get into some
deeper stuff but don't worry it's not
that if you go when you break it down
simply enough all right so without
further ado let's get into it all right
so we're going to be modeling a hip roof

1,"ght so without
further ado let's get into it all right
so we're going to be modeling a hip roof
for this house and of course there are
many types of roof as you can see in
this picture right here but we're
sticking with probably the most popular
and second most basic roof of our design
which is the hip roof following right
behind the gable roof design it is
important to note those that AutoCAD
does not have the ability to auto
generate a timber roof framing structure
something that looks like th"
2,"s not have the ability to auto
generate a timber roof framing structure
something that looks like this which
would include like each rafter each
truss and each roof member like the
ridge board and the hip rafters and all
of that now there are other software's
like
archicad our chief architect that has
the ability to do this AutoCAD is just
not one of those software however what
AutoCAD is capable of doing is to model
a profile of the roof that looks
something like this now this is a lot to
model"
3,"of doing is to model
a profile of the roof that looks
something like this now this is a lot to
model this is very detail so I would
rather to simplify it to something that
looks more like this which is what we're
going to be modeling in this drawing
today the reason for doing this is so
that when we create our sectional views
we would be able to see the profile and
all the materials that are present in
the roof all right so with that said
let's get into the video so the first
thing we're going t"
4,"nt in
the roof all right so with that said
let's get into the video so the first
thing we're going to be doing here is to
go back to our plan view top 2d
wireframe now we need to find the roof
tool which is actually right here under
the Home tab so you could go down and
click on a roof or we could go to the
tool pallet and simply select it down
here as well we're gonna go ahead and
click on the tool and the first thing
we're gonna do is to draw a random roof
outside here it doesn't matter the sh"
5,"ol and the first thing
we're gonna do is to draw a random roof
outside here it doesn't matter the shape
or the size just draw something so no
good time to practice so just click 1 2
3 4 something that looks like that good
enough and what we're gonna do is to
convert this roof so this is considered
a layout of the roof it's actually not
the roof as yet so what we're going to
do to convert this by clicking on this
button and we're converting it from what
it is to a standard slab and we're gonna
er"
6,"licking on this
button and we're converting it from what
it is to a standard slab and we're gonna
erase this geometry so we're gonna hit
OK and this is what the standard roof
slab looks like what we're doing really
is to create the profile first before we
actually put it on the house so that's
why we're doing this random one outside
here so we're gonna click on one of
these roof slab and we're gonna copy
style this is how we create our own
profile by copying one and modifying it
so we're copying"
7,"na copy
style this is how we create our own
profile by copying one and modifying it
so we're copying that style we're gonna
change the name to no standard roof
profile you could be more detailed
of course but I'm just gonna do that for
this demonstration I'm gonna drag this
up so we can see what we're looking at
all right so we're gonna make our
profile look like what we have on the
left side of the screen so we should
have a rafter at the bottom we should
have this arcing in the middle and a
ro"
8,"he screen so we should
have a rafter at the bottom we should
have this arcing in the middle and a
roof covering at the top okay so that's
what
we want to see here so far we only have
one material which is this down here we
need to have some more so we're gonna
add them up here so this one we're gonna
change the name to rafters or rafter and
the thickness of the rafter should be
what six inches make that zero click and
we're gonna make the offset to be zero
as well and so now as we make changes w"
9,"e that zero click and
we're gonna make the offset to be zero
as well and so now as we make changes we
can see the difference down here so far
we have the rafter on top of the the
this zero line I actually want a rafter
to be in a negative side so we're gonna
just turn this six into a minus six and
boom just like that the rafter is now
inside of the negative portion okay and
it says zero here that's because it is
also resting on the zero line so we're
gonna add our second material by
clicking on"
10,"s because it is
also resting on the zero line so we're
gonna add our second material by
clicking on the add component button
here the second one we're gonna call it
the psyching and the psyching is how
thick three and a quarter inch this time
it's going to be on the positive side so
we don't need a negative before it so
now you can see it popping up on top of
there after just like that I'm gonna add
our third one which would be the roof
covering and we're giving the roof
covering a thickness of"
11,"dd
our third one which would be the roof
covering and we're giving the roof
covering a thickness of three inches
three inches it can be two inches as
well or depending on the roof covering
that you're using
so the typical zinc or galvanized sheet
would be more than like two inches and
we wanted to start on top of the circle
which is already three three quarters so
we need to write the 3/4 here as well so
we have
oops let's go back to the front view so
we have the rafters below six inches
thick t"
12,"well so
we have
oops let's go back to the front view so
we have the rafters below six inches
thick to the zero mark then we have the
sacking from zero to three quarters and
we have the roof covering starting at
the 3/4 up to the three inches and
that's it we're gonna hit OK and we're
good to go
so now we can go ahead and draw our roof
on top of this so we're gonna go ahead
and click here and we're gonna go and go
to roof and just go ahead and draw your
alright so we're gonna click the first
corn"
13,"gonna go and go
to roof and just go ahead and draw your
alright so we're gonna click the first
corner here and we always draw the roof
on the exterior of the wall and the roof
should always be on a load-bearing wall
so all of these walls on this house are
load-bearing so we're good
click here back down to the third corner
and as we draw you can see the roof
coming together I'm gonna click over
here and that's about it we can hit
enter so now you can see that we have a
nice hip roof on top of th"
14,"re and that's about it we can hit
enter so now you can see that we have a
nice hip roof on top of the house we can
make this a gable roof if we want we
could just click on it like that and
drag these points outwards like so all
right so now this side becomes gable and
of course we could make this side gable
as well by pulling it out like that all
right what we're gonna be using the hip
style roof so I undo that back to the
hip roof I'm gonna go to the front view
like so by the way let's delete t"
15,"so I undo that back to the
hip roof I'm gonna go to the front view
like so by the way let's delete this we
don't need this anymore all right so we
go back to the front view and I want to
just show you a couple of things here
let me put this in
right so we can change a couple of
things about this roof after the fact we
can actually change the thickness of the
roof which would be how thick the roof
is we could change the edge cut which is
the cut of the edge from square to plum
and plum is what lo"
16,"is we could change the edge cut which is
the cut of the edge from square to plum
and plum is what looks like this I mean
you know the regular stuff but I'm gonna
leave it on square the Metallica stand
the overhang is 1 foot which is usually
what we use in Jamaica so the overhang
is from the edge of the wall to where
the roof ends okay and we have the plate
height and in order for me to show you
the plate height I'm gonna have to go
back into the 2d the plate ad is right
where the wall meets the"
17,"e plate height I'm gonna have to go
back into the 2d the plate ad is right
where the wall meets the roof okay
so right here is the plate height so the
plate right as you can see is 10 feet
which is the same height of the wall so
the wall is also 10 feet tall
we need the roof to sit exactly on top
of the wall just like that so the plate
height also need to be 10 feet and then
finally we can change the slope of the
roof if we want we can make it 45
degrees and of course the more degrees
you add th"
18,"the slope of the
roof if we want we can make it 45
degrees and of course the more degrees
you add the higher the roof will get so
we don't want to do that but they're not
trying to bring it down to 30 degrees
and it should look something like that
so once you're satisfied with how the
roof is laid out then we're gonna go
back to our top view to D and we're
satisfied with how the roof is laid out
now is the time to convert the roof okay
you do not convert if you're not
satisfied so we're satisfie"
19,"ow is the time to convert the roof okay
you do not convert if you're not
satisfied so we're satisfied we're gonna
convert and you know this is where we
would select the one that we had created
earlier
so we're gonna sneak that we're gonna
hear hit the erase button to erase this
one I'm gonna say okay and just like
that if I should go to 3d we can see
that our roof is now the one that we did
it has the profile it has the rafter
down here it has the Tsar king and it
also has the roof covering on t"
20,"the profile it has the rafter
down here it has the Tsar king and it
also has the roof covering on top of it
okay and yeah that's that's what we want
put it in x-ray so we can see it a
little better so what we're gonna do
next is to add a fascia board on on the
edge of these roof okay so let's go back
to top view 2d and our fascia board
should be 1 inch by 10 inch so what
we're gonna do is to draw a box anywhere
somewhere polyline that box should
measure 1 inches by 10 inches of course
you have"
21,"a box anywhere
somewhere polyline that box should
measure 1 inches by 10 inches of course
you have different size fascia boards so
you'd go ahead and draw the one that you
would prefer gonna click close the box
and we're going to click on the box and
we're going to right click and go down
to convert to profile definition just
like that it says here select your
insertion point so we're gonna select
the top left corner as the insertion
point then it says do we want to create
a new one or add it t"
22,"t
the top left corner as the insertion
point then it says do we want to create
a new one or add it to an existing one
we want to create any one
now we're gonna call this standard 1 by
10 fascia profile
okay and just like that we can now add
it to the edge of our roof so how do we
do that we're gonna click on this go to
edit style we're gonna go down to roof
slab edge style so modifying the edge of
the roof and we need to get it inside of
here okay so it's pretty simple we're
gonna copy this one"
23,"the roof and we need to get it inside of
here okay so it's pretty simple we're
gonna copy this one and we're gonna
paste it and we're gonna rename it to
standard one by ten fish proof you can
add a description if you want and then
we go to default and we would turn these
off go over to design rules and then
we're gonna add the fascia okay so we
check it and we go and select the one
that we just create so we're gonna click
on that and we're gonna uncheck this you
can if you want
I usually just u"
24,"reate so we're gonna click
on that and we're gonna uncheck this you
can if you want
I usually just uncheck it cuz I would I
don't want it to auto adjust and here we
can also add a soffit
which would look something like this we
could actually create our own soffit
profile and add it inside here just like
we did with the fascia profile alright
once that is done guys that's it you hit
OK and now we need to add that fascia
board to the edge of these roof all
right so that's what we're gonna do I'm
g"
25,"eed to add that fascia
board to the edge of these roof all
right so that's what we're gonna do I'm
gonna do this box so I'm gonna go to 3d
so that you can see see it as it
happened all right
first age I'm gonna do is this one so
this particle this side of the roof has
three edges and we want to add it to
this edge right here so we're gonna
click on that roof and we're gonna go to
edges over here and we want to change
the first edge style to the one that we
create okay
just like that okay now it"
26,"nd we want to change
the first edge style to the one that we
create okay
just like that okay now it has a fascia
board on it can you see that going to do
the same thing for this one
edge go to the first one add the fascia
board to it we're gonna do the same
thing around here edge finish the board
just like that
I'm in for the last one which is this
guy right here I'm gonna do the same
thing yep yep just like that so now all
four edges of our roof has the fascia
board added to it let me go perspe"
27,"p just like that so now all
four edges of our roof has the fascia
board added to it let me go perspective
alright so there we can see that our
roof is now complete
now there's one thing that I also wanted
to do which was to make this wall in the
middle let me show you this wall I want
to make this wall so that it goes all
the way up underneath this roof to
support the roof we don't have to do it
but I just want to show you how to get
that done okay and the same principle
would apply if we're usi"
28,"ut I just want to show you how to get
that done okay and the same principle
would apply if we're using a gable roof
where if the roof goes up in goes up
like a gable roof you would need this
wall to go up underneath that roof and
it's pretty simple alright so what we're
gonna do is to click on the wall like
just like that now we're gonna go up
here where it says where is it roof line
and we're gonna see modify roof no
modifier roof line if you're not seeing
it here you could actually just right"
29,"na see modify roof no
modifier roof line if you're not seeing
it here you could actually just right
click and go to roof line modify roof
line don't you do that we're gonna say
Auto project so I wanted to auto project
and we need to select the objects that
we want
- project - I wanted to project this
wall to this roof rather as well as this
one around here so you need to select
these two hoops to reflect this one just
like that and then we're gonna hit enter
and it's done it's done you can't see"
