  "full_text": "[Music] hey what's up everybody welcome to episode number four for one bedroom series now in today's video we are gonna be drawing walls yes and it's about time it's about time to start getting to the fun stuff now there are many types of was of course we're not going to get into all of them but we're gonna talk about the one that we're gonna use on this building and that one is called CMU six huh now CMU stands for concrete masonry unit okay so this is a concrete masonry unit and there are many others such as this this one that what is that that that that yep but the one we're gonna be using is this one yes no you all know what I'm talking about it's the same one that we call a regular concrete block the proper name for it is CMU 6 and the 6 at the end stands for how deep of the block is and when you hear deep you're thinking about up and down right but now when I talk about depth we're actually talking about how wide of a wall it creates or how thick of a wall it creates okay so drill that in your head somewhere of course there are many different sizes we're gonna stick with this one which is the 6 by 8 by 16 all right and so yeah this is the one that we're most familiar with in Jamaica and other parts of the Caribbean yeah so let's go over to AutoCAD and find out where we can find this wall and how to get it in or join alright guys so let's get into it alright guys so here we are back in the drawing and the last place we left off was here where we import the grids into our ground floor now if you miss that people please go back and watch it alright because what we did was to layout our grid lines over here and then no we imported it into our ground floor as a external reference file alright now if you have this tab over here called external references okay this is where you can actually see all the external references that are in your project alright so I have the grid lines loaded as you can see when I click on it it becomes highlighted over there it's now loaded into my ground floor ok I can actually unload it I can reload it I can detach it I can do a lot of things from this manager here so if you're not seeing this tab like so you would find it down here this little paperclip looking icon that says manage xrefs now if you're not seeing it down here you could actually type the command X ref all right and it should bring it up so this is where you'd manage all of your external references later on when we're gonna do a property boundary we can also load it into this project as an external reference all right one other thing I want to point out is you want to make sure that your grid lines is loaded in as an overlay ok we can switch between overlay and touch what we wanted to be overly that way it's it's not heavy on your computer the file doesn't become very heavy because if we should attach it what is gonna do is to copy all of your greens into this drawing and make this drawing heavy we don't want that okay the other thing I want to point out is let me minimize that let me minimize this the grid line is located in the same position in this drawing as its original drawing that's a beautiful thing alright so when we draw our walls on top of this it's located in the same position from the zero zero point okay I just wanted to pawn it or that well no if I mix if I mean if I'm a printer if I'm explaining it properly what I hope you get the point no what we need to do is to just draw some walls okay so we need to find a was so we you find was over here so in this palette the same palette where we found our column stuff if you go down you'll see walls now if you're not seeing walls you would click on these little Settings icon and you'd say all palettes originally it was on this design what this would do is to bring all your palettes out alright and then find one for this drawing we want to use CMU 6 ok so let's look if we see that here mmm doesn't look like it's there so we need to go and find it all right now they're probably a couple of ways you can do it we could click on this more wall tools and it would bring you to the wall the walls catalog alright where we'd find bricks in you stud all the different types of walls but if you're not seeing the wall tab what you could actually do is go to your tools and go to content browser and here we would search for our walls so we would go into imperial since this is the one that we're doing if you're doing metric you'll go to metric all right so we're doing imperial and then we'd go down and search for walls oops and we're looking at CMU good just let's follow the lead and we need to see a new six so far we see ten we don't need that therefore we don't need that look at that here we go we have six so I actually want this to appear in my tool palette all right so what I'm gonna do is to say add to tool palette okay cuz this is the one that we want there we go it's down here okay and I'm gonna just drag him to the top cuz I'm I'm pretty much gonna use this all the time I'm not sure about these other ones but this is what we use in Jamaica most of the time so we're gonna work with that okay so let's begin to draw with this tool so if click on it of course we could go ahead and just start to draw what we need to fix up a couple of things over here first we need to ensure the height of the wall that we want we're gonna change our justify settings to Center I'm gonna explain why we do that in a little bit and if there's any other little thing you wanted adjust but those are the two main things you want to check all right the height of the wall we're gonna work with 10 feet I think that's what we sit in our levels I could actually check it back let's check it 10 good so we're gonna leave it at 10 all right so remember we set our justifier to center because when we go to draw the wall we want we want a gridline to fall in the center of the wall okay in the center of the wall so if you notice if I should start to draw here the grid line is now in the center of the wall so we're going to go ahead and draw a wall all the way around so let's turn on our Arthur mode so that we can get very straight walls so click on a one and then we're going to move over to a four click all the way down to be four quick back over to be one click and then we could go back up to a 1 and click or we could just click the close button down here okay let's do the guy right here is close and what that does is to just close the box for you so right now we have our external walls so we just need to get the internal walls let's do it so we're not gonna use this again what we're gonna do is to click on one of the walls and we're gonna say it add selected because what this does is to add this all the settings that you've already set for the external walls we're gonna use it for the internal walls all right so we're gonna click on what's this a 3 connect it to be 3 so that's all first wall there and then we're gonna do the same thing for this one from right here all the way down to yeah now if you look on the drawing by the way guys if you're following with the same exact drawing you can download it from the link in the description all right so go ahead and download it and follow them now this wall wouldn't be I wouldn't come all the way down to here so what we're going to do is we're going to draw our kitchen we're gonna complete the kitchen the bathroom and the bedroom so let's do that so the first thing I'm gonna do is to draw a line because we know that the kitchen should be nine feet coming down so we're gonna draw a wall that measures nine feet enter we're gonna draw a line that measures five feet from here and we're gonna draw a line again that measures the bedroom is what a level feet so we need a wall right here we need a wall right here and we need a wall right there so what I'm gonna do is to draw some random was so let's do that click on this C and selected and then we're gonna just draw some walls so just draw a wallet right here I'm gonna do the same thing draw one right here and we're gonna do the same thing down here and the next thing we're gonna do is to move the walls so we're gonna click on that and we're gonna say move here we go I want to move it from this point the center where you see the triangle click on it and move it all the way down to the box now if you're not seeing the triangle guys it's because your snap settings needs to be adjusted all right so you can go down to this little icon here click on it and make sure you turn on all of these okay you need to turn all of these on okay except this one I don't try this one on but you can if you want all right so we're gonna do the same thing for this wall gonna move it from the center here down to that point I'm gonna move this one as well yeah so do you so I guess what all we need to do is trim off those little so we're going to do is the type use a trim tool right here and we're gonna press enter once enter and as chop off the edge chop enough all right so back and guess what we don't need this piece of wall either so oops oops oh my goodness so guess what guys we're done let's delete these lines cuz we don't need the money now of course we could check to make sure that these guys are measuring up to what we want them to be our bathroom should be what five you know like this bathroom should be 6 mm so we need to move this wall down one foot so let's move in click click on the wall drag it down and then type 12 which is you know that 12 inches is the same as one foot right yeah enter and then let's check in again so it's good to check all right that's good and then we check this one and that's looking lovely so guess what guys that's it for this video we are through drawing our walls so what I'm gonna do is to view it in 3d let's see what it looks like actually I'm going to turn these dimensions off I don't like these right now so it could go up there switch tools so if you look actually all of these are on their grid line layers it's so beautiful I like how our talk I just organized my layers for me all right so I could just shut that thing off all right so let's look at it in 3d and we're gonna go look at it in hidden details and I'm gonna turn it into perspective I like seeing things in perspective you know wow look at that it's almost like a real all-star general Park a really blocky even real ting matter Fred [Music] you know what come to me quarantine you know isolate yourself into one of these buildings so that's it guys for this video we did our walls and in the next video we're going to be drawing or windows and doors alright so that's gonna be another exciting episode so I hope you learned something from this and if you have any questions drop them in the comments you know what to do already so thanks again for joining and I hope to see you in the next video meet up to several of us [Music] you",
