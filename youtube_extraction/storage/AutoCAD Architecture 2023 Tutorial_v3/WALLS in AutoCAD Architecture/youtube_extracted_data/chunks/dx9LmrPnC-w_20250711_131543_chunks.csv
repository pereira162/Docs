hey what's up everybody welcome to
episode number four for one bedroom
series now in today's video we are gonna
be drawing walls yes
and it's about time it's about time to
start getting to the fun stuff now there
are many types of was of course we're
not going to get into all of them but
we're gonna talk about the one that
we're gonna use on this building and
that one is called CMU six huh now CMU
stands for concrete masonry unit okay so
this is a concrete masonry unit and
there are many"
1,"now CMU
stands for concrete masonry unit okay so
this is a concrete masonry unit and
there are many others such as this this
one that what is that that that that yep
but the one we're gonna be using is this
one yes no you all know what I'm talking
about
it's the same one that we call a regular
concrete block the proper name for it is
CMU 6 and the 6 at the end stands for
how deep of the block is and when you
hear deep you're thinking about up and
down right but now when I talk about
depth we're"
2,"and when you
hear deep you're thinking about up and
down right but now when I talk about
depth we're actually talking about how
wide of a wall it creates or how thick
of a wall it creates okay so drill that
in your head somewhere of course there
are many different sizes we're gonna
stick with this one which is the 6 by 8
by 16 all right and so yeah this is the
one that we're most familiar with in
Jamaica and other parts of the Caribbean
yeah so let's go over to AutoCAD and
find out where we can"
3,"Jamaica and other parts of the Caribbean
yeah so let's go over to AutoCAD and
find out where we can find this wall and
how to get it in
or join alright guys so let's get into
it alright guys so here we are back in
the drawing and the last place we left
off was here where we import the grids
into our ground floor now if you miss
that people please go back and watch it
alright because what we did was to
layout our grid lines over here and then
no we imported it into our ground floor
as a external"
4,"s to
layout our grid lines over here and then
no we imported it into our ground floor
as a external reference file alright now
if you have this tab over here called
external references okay this is where
you can actually see all the external
references that are in your project
alright so I have the grid lines loaded
as you can see when I click on it it
becomes highlighted over there it's now
loaded into my ground floor ok I can
actually unload it
I can reload it I can detach it I can do
a lot of"
5,"d into my ground floor ok I can
actually unload it
I can reload it I can detach it I can do
a lot of things from this manager here
so if you're not seeing this tab like so
you would find it down here this little
paperclip looking icon that says manage
xrefs now if you're not seeing it down
here you could actually type the command
X ref all right and it should bring it
up so this is where you'd manage all of
your external references later on when
we're gonna do a property boundary we
can also loa"
6,"age all of
your external references later on when
we're gonna do a property boundary we
can also load it into this project as an
external reference all right one other
thing I want to point out is you want to
make sure that your grid lines is loaded
in as an overlay ok we can switch
between overlay and
touch what we wanted to be overly that
way it's it's not heavy on your computer
the file doesn't become very heavy
because if we should attach it what is
gonna do is to copy all of your greens
int"
7,"become very heavy
because if we should attach it what is
gonna do is to copy all of your greens
into this drawing and make this drawing
heavy we don't want that okay the other
thing I want to point out is let me
minimize that let me minimize this the
grid line is located in the same
position in this drawing as its original
drawing that's a beautiful thing
alright so when we draw our walls on top
of this it's located in the same
position from the zero zero point okay
I just wanted to pawn it or"
8,"of this it's located in the same
position from the zero zero point okay
I just wanted to pawn it or that well no
if I mix if I mean if I'm a printer if
I'm explaining it properly what I hope
you get the point
no what we need to do is to just draw
some walls okay so we need to find a was
so we you find was over here so in this
palette the same palette where we found
our column stuff if you go down you'll
see walls now if you're not seeing walls
you would click on these little Settings
icon and yo"
9,"you'll
see walls now if you're not seeing walls
you would click on these little Settings
icon and you'd say all palettes
originally it was on this design what
this would do is to bring all your
palettes out alright and then find one
for this drawing we want to use CMU 6 ok
so let's look if we see that here mmm
doesn't look like it's there so we need
to go and find it all right now they're
probably a couple of ways you can do it
we could click on this more wall tools
and it would bring you to the"
10,"a couple of ways you can do it
we could click on this more wall tools
and it would bring you to the wall the
walls catalog alright where we'd find
bricks in you stud all the different
types of walls but if you're not seeing
the wall tab what you could actually do
is go to your tools and go to content
browser
and here we would search for our walls
so we would go into imperial since this
is the one that we're doing if you're
doing metric you'll go to metric all
right so we're doing imperial and t"
11,"that we're doing if you're
doing metric you'll go to metric all
right so we're doing imperial and then
we'd go down and search for walls oops
and we're looking at CMU good just let's
follow the lead and we need to see a new
six so far we see ten we don't need that
therefore we don't need that look at
that here we go we have six so I
actually want this to appear in my tool
palette all right so what I'm gonna do
is to say add to tool palette okay cuz
this is the one that we want there we go
it's"
12,"t I'm gonna do
is to say add to tool palette okay cuz
this is the one that we want there we go
it's down here okay and I'm gonna just
drag him to the top cuz I'm I'm pretty
much gonna use this all the time I'm not
sure about these other ones but this is
what we use in Jamaica most of the time
so we're gonna work with that okay so
let's begin to draw with this tool so if
click on it of course we could go ahead
and just start to draw what we need to
fix up a couple of things over here
first we nee"
13,"uld go ahead
and just start to draw what we need to
fix up a couple of things over here
first we need to ensure the height of
the wall that we want we're gonna change
our justify settings to Center
I'm gonna explain why we do that in a
little bit and if there's any other
little thing you wanted adjust but those
are the two main things you want to
check all right the height of the wall
we're gonna work with 10 feet I think
that's what we sit in our levels I could
actually check it back let's chec"
14,"work with 10 feet I think
that's what we sit in our levels I could
actually check it back let's check it 10
good so we're gonna leave it at 10 all
right so remember we set our justifier
to center because when we go to draw the
wall we want
we want a gridline to fall in the center
of the wall okay in the center of the
wall so if you notice if I should start
to draw here the grid line is now in the
center of the wall so we're going to go
ahead and draw a wall all the way around
so let's turn on ou"
15,"center of the wall so we're going to go
ahead and draw a wall all the way around
so let's turn on our Arthur mode so that
we can get very straight walls so click
on a one and then we're going to move
over to a four click all the way down to
be four quick back over to be one click
and then we could go back up to a 1 and
click or we could just click the close
button down here okay let's do the guy
right here is close and what that does
is to just close the box for you so
right now we have our exte"
16,"ight here is close and what that does
is to just close the box for you so
right now we have our external walls so
we just need to get the internal walls
let's do it so we're not gonna use this
again what we're gonna do is to click on
one of the walls and we're gonna say it
add selected because what this does is
to add this all the settings that you've
already set for the external walls we're
gonna use it for the internal walls all
right so we're gonna click on what's
this a 3 connect it to be 3"
17,"use it for the internal walls all
right so we're gonna click on what's
this a 3 connect it to be 3 so that's
all first wall there and then we're
gonna do the same thing for this one
from right here all the way down to yeah
now if you look on the drawing by the
way guys if you're following with the
same exact drawing you can download it
from the link in the description all
right so go ahead and download it and
follow them now this wall wouldn't be I
wouldn't
come all the way down to here so what"
18,"wnload it and
follow them now this wall wouldn't be I
wouldn't
come all the way down to here so what
we're going to do is we're going to draw
our kitchen we're gonna complete the
kitchen the bathroom and the bedroom so
let's do that so the first thing I'm
gonna do is to draw a line because we
know that the kitchen should be nine
feet coming down so we're gonna draw a
wall that measures nine feet enter we're
gonna draw a line that measures five
feet from here and we're gonna draw a
line again tha"
19,"nter we're
gonna draw a line that measures five
feet from here and we're gonna draw a
line again that measures the bedroom is
what a level feet so we need a wall
right here we need a wall right here and
we need a wall right there so what I'm
gonna do is to draw some random was so
let's do that click on this C and
selected and then we're gonna just draw
some walls so just draw a wallet right
here I'm gonna do the same thing
draw one right here and we're gonna do
the same thing down here and the n"
20,"'m gonna do the same thing
draw one right here and we're gonna do
the same thing down here and the next
thing we're gonna do is to move the
walls so we're gonna click on that and
we're gonna say move here we go I want
to move it from this point the center
where you see the triangle click on it
and move it all the way down to the box
now if you're not seeing the triangle
guys it's because your snap settings
needs to be adjusted all right so you
can go down to this little icon here
click on it and"
21,"settings
needs to be adjusted all right so you
can go down to this little icon here
click on it and make sure you turn on
all of these okay you need to turn all
of these on okay except this one I don't
try this one on but you can if you want
all right so we're gonna do the same
thing for this wall gonna move it
from the center here down to that point

is trim off those little so we're going
to do is the type use a t"
22,"so I guess what all we need to do

to do is the type use a trim tool right
here and we're gonna press enter once
enter and as chop off the edge chop
enough
all right so back and guess what we
don't need this piece of wall either so
oops oops oh my goodness so guess what
guys we're done let's delete these lines
cuz we don't need the money now of
course we could check to make sure that
these guys are measuring up to what we
want them to be our bathroom shoul"
23,"ld check to make sure that
these guys are measuring up to what we
want them to be our bathroom should be
what five you know like this bathroom
should be 6 mm so we need to move this
wall down one foot so let's move in
click click on the wall drag it down and
then type 12 which is you know that 12
inches is the same as one foot right
yeah enter and then let's check in again
so it's good to check all right that's

that's looking lovely so guess what guys
that's i"
24,"l right that's
good and then we check this one and
that's looking lovely so guess what guys
that's it for this video we are through
drawing our walls so what I'm gonna do
is to view it in 3d let's see what it
looks like actually I'm going to turn
these dimensions off I don't like these
right now so it could go up there switch
tools so if you look actually all of
these are on their grid line layers it's
so beautiful I like how our talk I just
organized my layers for me all right so
I could just s"
25,"it's
so beautiful I like how our talk I just
organized my layers for me all right so
I could just shut that thing off all
right so let's look at it in 3d and
we're gonna go look at it in hidden
details and I'm gonna turn it into
perspective
I like seeing things in perspective you
know wow look at that it's almost like a
real all-star general Park a really
blocky even real
ting matter Fred
[Music]
you know what come to me quarantine you

buildings so that's"
