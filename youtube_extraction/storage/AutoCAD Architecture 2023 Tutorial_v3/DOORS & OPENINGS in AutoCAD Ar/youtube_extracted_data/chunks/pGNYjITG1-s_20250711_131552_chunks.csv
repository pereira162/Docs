episode number five for one bedroom sins
so in the last video we did was and of
course you know we need we need to find
a way to enter the house correct so in
this video we're gonna be putting in our
doors and our openings I wanted to do
windows as well but the video will be a
little bit too long so I'm gonna just
cut it right there and then we do
windows

1,"Music]
all right so before we get started what
I want you to do is to get familiar with
the different types of doors and windows
it's important that you know how each
type of your work and all each type of
window work so without further ado let's
get into it all right so here we are in
autocad and the first thing i want to
mention is that you don't need to worry
about layers at this point because
AutoCAD will generate your layers for
you all right so for every tool that we
use over here for inst"
2,"AutoCAD will generate your layers for
you all right so for every tool that we
use over here for instance last video we
placed our wall AutoCAD creates a wall
layer for us it gives us a color it
gives us the line weight let me show you
alright so here we are it gives us a
color we can change the color it gives
us the line tab and the line width all
right the only thing I would probably
change is the color if I'm gonna change
anything I wouldn't change the line
weight because the line width is
act"
3,"e color if I'm gonna change
anything I wouldn't change the line
weight because the line width is
actually a good line weight to use the
recommended line width that AutoCAD
gives is what we're gonna work with all
right and it's the same thing when we
create our doors we will get a layer
four doors same thing for Windows and
other other elements that we're gonna be
creating all right without further ado
let's begin so I'm gonna go back to our
top view and I'm gonna go back to 2d
wireframe so this"
4,"ado
let's begin so I'm gonna go back to our
top view and I'm gonna go back to 2d
wireframe so this is where we left off
and we're gonna move forward from here
if you look at the bottom right of your
screen you're gonna see the door
schedule so on this building we have
three doors we have one at the entry
here from the porch to the living the
second door would be at the bedroom from
your living room to the bedroom and then
the third door would be from the bus
from the living ear to the bathroom"
5,"om to the bedroom and then
the third door would be from the bus
from the living ear to the bathroom so
we only have three simple doors on this
house and then we have three openings as
well we have one at the front here and
we have one here
and we have one to enter into the
kitchen alright so the first thing we're
gonna do is to put in our openings which
is actually very very easy by the way if
you need to this drawing you can
download it from the link in the
description as well as all the other"
6,"need to this drawing you can
download it from the link in the
description as well as all the other
materials that are related to this
particular drawing so let's go so of
course if you look under your tool
palette which is right here again if you
don't see this go to tools and click on
content no sorry
click on design tools alright and it
should bring up your tool palette and
under your tool palette we have a quite
a few stuff and now we're doing doors
under doors we do have this opening but
th"
7,"tte we have a quite
a few stuff and now we're doing doors
under doors we do have this opening but
this is not opening that we're looking
for
this is cased opening which means that
this opening has a frame okay and we
don't need a opening with a frame so
where we want to find the right opening
is we go back to design and we go down
to the opening we can find it here or we
can go to doors at the top here and we
find it here is the same thing so I'm
gonna use this one and the first thing
we're gonn"
8,"here and we
find it here is the same thing so I'm
gonna use this one and the first thing
we're gonna do here it says select a
wall or enter so we're going to select
this wall right here so we need a
opening right there
we need one right there we need one on
this wall so that's the first thing we
did was to just place our three openings
of course if you knew the size we could
set it over here before but sometimes we
just have to do it free handed nothing
is wrong with that
minimize that and then"
9,"re but sometimes we
just have to do it free handed nothing
is wrong with that
minimize that and then what we're going
to do is just stretch these out all
right
that's really simple I'm gonna stretch
these out like that all right so that's
good so we are left with a little square
here which we're gonna use as a column
in this corner and then we're going to
fix this one
if you look at the properties it is
three feet wide and we need it to be
four feet so let's fix that seven feet
high that's good"
10,"it is
three feet wide and we need it to be
four feet so let's fix that seven feet
high that's good and everything is looks
good so and then we're going to move it
over into this corner so to go and grab
our move tool and we're going to move it
over like that so now all our openings
are done let's look at it in 3d
so now we can see that our openings have
been created beautiful so now we can get
on to the porch
no we need to get into the house muscle
all right bus let's get it back to the
plant v"
11,"to the porch
no we need to get into the house muscle
all right bus let's get it back to the
plant view before we move to the doors
what I'm gonna do is to put these the
openings on a hidden line layer all
right so as a matter of fact a layer has
been created for it already there we go
so what we're gonna do is to open our
layers palette you know if you can't
find this this is the little guy that is
responsible so you just click on that
and it's gonna bring up your layers
palette and then we're"
12,"is
responsible so you just click on that
and it's gonna bring up your layers
palette and then we're gonna go to
opening and we're going to change it
from continuous to hidden and then we're
gonna minimize that so now you can see
that your your arch are your openings
are being represented by dotted lines
which is what we want
all right the next thing we're gonna do
is to enter our doors all right
so we go back to our tool palette I'm
gonna stick it over I would go down to
doors all right now if y"
13,"o we go back to our tool palette I'm
gonna stick it over I would go down to
doors all right now if you look on the
door schedule it says that door one
which is located at the entryway right
here is a single hinge six panel
half-light all right now if you look
over here I already have it in my pallet
but I don't think you would have it in
yours all right so where do you find it
you would go to the more tools all right
which would bring up more all right and
in here you'll find a good amount of
do"
14,"more tools all right
which would bring up more all right and
in here you'll find a good amount of
doors
we have bifold double we have buy a full
single these are the ones would use on
that closet we have the keys open the
one that we spoke about earlier know
when you see double this means that that
door is
Dumbledore it has two doors swinging
alright what we need is a single doors
of the go across until we find single
door and this is the one that I chose
for this project you can go ahead I
thin"
15,"until we find single
door and this is the one that I chose
for this project you can go ahead I
think this would be the more suitable
one to use in Jamaica you know the six
panel solid rock
nobody can push it on back too easily
this is the one you don't want to use
alright any at all in Jamaica that is
what I'm gonna just use this one for fun
what you would do is to insert into your
drawing or add to palette in this case I
have already added it to my palette
which is right here so I'm gonna just"
16,"to palette in this case I
have already added it to my palette
which is right here so I'm gonna just
get rid of that so I click on it right
here and then I'll go ahead and drop the
door where I want it of course we could
actually just click on any wall but we
want it on this wall and we want it to
be on the inside of it if I wanted it on
the outside we could you know click on
the outside there so when you click the
door we could actually change the
direction of the door by clicking these
arrows"
17,"when you click the
door we could actually change the
direction of the door by clicking these
arrows alright and if you notice this
door is too small that's because we did
not set the size door that we wanted so
this door should be three feet wide by
seven feet high and we wanted to measure
to the outside of the frame I'm going to
explain that to you in a minute and then
we want a swing to be 90 degrees all
right if we change this to let's say 45
degrees
you notice what happened over here the
doo"
18,"grees all
right if we change this to let's say 45
degrees
you notice what happened over here the
door is now at a 45 degree angle we
could actually close the door
if we want it to but we're going to
leave it at 90 and everything else looks
good alright so you can see the type of
door that we have here that's the one
that we need and we're gonna go ahead
and we're gonna move it from here
down to the corner there alright so
that's all front door
so what I wanted to explain to you is
what is what d"
19,"e corner there alright so
that's all front door
so what I wanted to explain to you is
what is what does it mean by measure
outside of the frame so if I should
actually measure the width of this door
which we set for a three feet it would
measure to the outside of the frame all
right in some instances you might want
to put it on the inside of the frame
which would mean that the three feet
would measure on the inside of the frame
okay guys so we're gonna leave it at
outside and the next thing I'm"
20,"sure on the inside of the frame
okay guys so we're gonna leave it at
outside and the next thing I'm gonna do
is to Center this door in between these
walls all right I know that
on the drawing the door is exactly right
here but we're gonna Center it on this
wall for this project so let's go ahead
and hit the center button up here and
we're gonna hit enter twice one two once
you hit Enter twice then we're gonna
click on the first corner and then we're
gonna click on the second corner and the
door"
21,"we're gonna
click on the first corner and then we're
gonna click on the second corner and the
door would automatically move to the
center of the space this can be done
with any thing in a drawing I could
Center this wall using the same method
between these two walls all right by
right clicking going to a EC Center is
the same thing all right so our first
door has been placed let's go ahead and
place our second door which is on the
bedroom and this door is a single hinge
now we don't need to sea"
22,"ace our second door which is on the
bedroom and this door is a single hinge
now we don't need to search for this
door because it's actually right here so
we're gonna just click on it like so and
let's do something let's actually pick
the size that we need before we place it
so the size we actually need is 3 feet
by 7 and we're going to do a couple of
adjustments let's say outside of frame
perfect 90 degrees
all right this time we're gonna actually
put in some location now what I want is
for the"
23,"90 degrees
all right this time we're gonna actually
put in some location now what I want is
for the door to be exactly in the center
this one this piece of wall right here
from here to here alright so how do you
do that we could actually change that to
offset Center and I'm gonna change the
justification to Center and how far from
the center do you want it zero because
you want it exactly in the center so
we're going to let that be zero now
we're just gonna click on this wall now
if you'll notic"
24,"enter so
we're going to let that be zero now
we're just gonna click on this wall now
if you'll notice if i zoom in a little
bit you see those two measurement on the
top on the bottom that it that says nine
inches on both sides that's what I'm
talking about so the door would snap to
the exact center of the world any wall
that I have so guess what if I put it on
this wall the door automatically snap to
the middle of the wall let me try
another one so you can see look at that
alright and this is wh"
25,"to
the middle of the wall let me try
another one so you can see look at that
alright and this is what we're gonna do
for our windows cuz all our windows will
be centered in the wall all right
so let's place this door right here
again go ahead and flip the door like
that by the way guys a general rule of
thumb is to always flip your door or
swing your door towards a wall okay you
don't want your doors to be swinging up
into the room like that this is poor
design and it's a waste of space
alright"
26,"oors to be swinging up
into the room like that this is poor
design and it's a waste of space
alright so if you'll notice on this
building all doors are swinging towards
a wall unless it's a very tight
situation you just have to do what you
have to do but always practice to swing
your doors towards a wall alright so
let's go ahead and create our third door
which is the bathroom door now it's
actually the same door so we could
actually go ahead and click on that over
there and then we're gonna set"
27,"ly the same door so we could
actually go ahead and click on that over
there and then we're gonna set the size
of the door which is what two feet eight
inches and we're going to search for
that in here by seven outside of frame
19 and this time I want to do it to be
exactly
here so what we could actually do is in
down here is to say offset left okay
now when you click on the wall the door
would actually be adjusted exactly on
the wall any side of the wall because I
have the offset to be zero let'"
28,"ually be adjusted exactly on
the wall any side of the wall because I
have the offset to be zero let's say I
wanted the door three inches off of the
wall
I could actually type in three inches
here three inches all right so three
inches would you can know you can see
that the door is offset at three inches
from the corner of the wall
all right so there we have it our three
doors have been placed I know of course
we can't leave without looking at it in
3d so of course let's go ahead and put
it in 3"
29,"now of course
we can't leave without looking at it in
3d so of course let's go ahead and put
it in 3d I'm gonna turn this into 3d and
we're gonna make it perspective
alright so that is it for this video
guys except one thing that I'm gonna do
and is to put a little arch here and
it's pretty ain't pretty simple you
click on the opening let's see if I
can't click on it from here click on the
opening aisle over here is the shape you
could actually change it from rectangle
to round if you change it"
