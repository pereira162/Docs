0,"hi everyone this is episode 11 for one
bedroom house
series and today what we're gonna do is
to start working on our site plan so
what that means is that we're gonna lay
out what I want is site to look like
we're gonna do some landscape word plant
some trees some grass and a couple look
at things you know to make it look like
somewhere we would actually want to live
[Music]
okay so drawing your side plant can be
another fun activity so on a side plan
you get the opportunity to make the
landscape"
1,"de plant can be
another fun activity so on a side plan
you get the opportunity to make the
landscape exactly how you want it to
look so we get to add a various trees
shrubs edging gardens driveway pavements
pools etc etc but for today's
demonstration I'm gonna make it very
simple we're gonna just do the basic
stuff and I might just add one or two
little thing here and there but nothing
too deep I leave that for you to
experiment all right
now the question is why do we need a
site plan the site p"
2,"leave that for you to
experiment all right
now the question is why do we need a
site plan the site plan is actually a
very important plan and the Municipal
Corporation will need this drawing in
order to know where the building is
located on the site they want to know if
you are abiding by setbacks and zoning
regulations they want to see you how the
drainage is laid hope they wanna see
what the landscape looks like all of
that they want to see also the site plan
is being used by the contractor be"
3,"dscape looks like all of
that they want to see also the site plan
is being used by the contractor because
when the contractor is ready to lay out
the building he will need to know where
to start laying on the billion euros
that the site plan is also used by
landscapers the guys who are gonna come
in and plant the trees they need to know
where to plant which tree we're to put
the pavement and our
that kind of stuff Meza and also later
on the home owner might want to do
additions to the building o"
4,"hat kind of stuff Meza and also later
on the home owner might want to do
additions to the building or to sell the
property and this side plan would be
required to do any of these tasks all
right now with all of that said let's
get over into AutoCAD and see what we
can do over there alright guys so here
we are back in the drawing so if you
remember when we set up the project from
day one we had created a property
boundary construct and it would have
been in this drawing that we would have
created"
5,"ated a property
boundary construct and it would have
been in this drawing that we would have
created our property boundary all right
so let's let me open this drawing up and
as you can see here I already have a
layout of the property that we're going
to be placing the building on I recently
did a video on how to do this so if you
don't know how to do it
oh and watch that video so the diagram
would be found on the surveys report and
we would use the the bearings and the
distance is provided by th"
6,"be found on the surveys report and
we would use the the bearings and the
distance is provided by the surveyor to
get this diagram because we need to make
sure that it is as accurate as possible
all right no the first part of this
video that I'm gonna be doing should
have been done from even before we
started to do the ground floor and the
foundation alright this is something
that I I overlooked in the beginning of
this project so what I'm gonna be doing
is to split this video into so what I'm
g"
7,"n the beginning of
this project so what I'm gonna be doing
is to split this video into so what I'm
gonna do first is to show you what we
should have done from the beginning of
the project and then in Part 2 or the
second half of this video I'm gonna be
showing what we would do after which
would be at this point in the in the
project alright alright so after we have
the the drawing the diagram looking like
this what we would do is - first thing I
would say set the scale so make sure
that your sca"
8,"ing like
this what we would do is - first thing I
would say set the scale so make sure
that your scale is 1/8 and this is
equivalent to 1 in 100 if you're using
millimeters as your units this is like
that the regular scale that we use
because the building is really small if
you had a very large building then we
would probably go for one in 16 which
would be the same as 1 in 200 and so on
and so forth all right so we're gonna
work with one it perfect and the second
thing we're gonna do is to crea"
9,"rth all right so we're gonna
work with one it perfect and the second
thing we're gonna do is to create some
layers alright remember that we're going
to be placing trees pavement and so on
so I want to create a layer for all of
these elements alright so I have my
layers palette right here if you don't
know where to find it it is right here
and this little guy right here layer
properties and I actually have a video
on how to create layers so if you don't
know how to create layers check that
video"
10,"lly have a video
on how to create layers so if you don't
know how to create layers check that
video out but for this video I'm gonna
just go right ahead and create some
layers I'm gonna put a s before all of
them just to say this is a layer that is
on a site plan so the S represents site
all right put a - and the first one I'm
gonna create is the property line I'm
gonna change the color to blue maybe
that you can choose the color you want
we usually use Phantom for the line type
and the line Oit"
11,"ybe
that you can choose the color you want
we usually use Phantom for the line type
and the line Oita I'm gonna just set it
at probably point 4 then I'll create a
new one call this one setback and I'm
gonna make this one red and I'm gonna
change it from phantom to - and I'm
gonna make the line wait a little bit
promise 13 I think all the others are
gonna be 0.13 so create another one call
this one pavement enter I'm going to
give this a gray color
and I'm gonna make this continuous and
I'm gonna"
12,"pavement enter I'm going to
give this a gray color
and I'm gonna make this continuous and
I'm gonna leave it on the 13 create
another one call this one vegetation and
of course the vegetation would be some
sorta green color continuous 13 perfect
and then I'm gonna create one last one
I'm gonna call this one the road and of
course you can choose whichever color
you would like and the line width is
just about what I have here you can work
with the language but that's for the
hour for the line typ"
13,"just about what I have here you can work
with the language but that's for the
hour for the line type and the color I
would say try to adopt these ones until
you're able to come up with your own
style and technique alright so so far we
can see now that we have all of these
layers inside of our drop-down here so
the first thing we're going to do is to
draw the road so let's go to the road
layer and of course we want to represent
as close as possible the width of the
road and if there's a sidewalk"
14,"of course we want to represent
as close as possible the width of the
road and if there's a sidewalk and that
kind of thing so for this for this
diagram I'm gonna put a sidewalk of five
feet all right and the road width would
be 18 feet and these would depend on the
area alright so if it is a city area you
know you would have a wider street and
maybe a wider sidewalk and if it's a
more residential rural here you'd have a
narrower street and a narrower sidewalk
and you might have sidewalks on bot"
15,"rural here you'd have a
narrower street and a narrower sidewalk
and you might have sidewalks on both
side or on one side whatever the case
may be alright so make sure you go on
the side and you try to get an accurate
measurement and so what I'm gonna do now
is to just offset well draw a line first
here now let's turn the artha more on
like that
well this kind of stretch it out a
little bit further off of the back now
what I'm gonna do is to offset the
sidewalk from this line so I'm gonna
make i"
16,"r off of the back now
what I'm gonna do is to offset the
sidewalk from this line so I'm gonna
make it five feet away from that
then I'm gonna offset another 18 feet
which would be the width off the road so
let's do a sit again 18 feet enter and
then that would be the width of the road
of course we could add another sidewalk
here but I don't care about this side of
the road I want to care about this side
right now so I'm gonna leave it right
there what I'm gonna do is to get the
center line in th"
17,"s side
right now so I'm gonna leave it right
there what I'm gonna do is to get the
center line in the middle of the road
though because that's gonna be an
important line that we will need later
on in this video all right so we're
gonna do another offset and the middle
of that road would actually be 9 feet
all right so there we have our 9 feet
and I'm gonna actually change the line
type here to dashed so that it looks
like our road would look of course the
dashed line would mean you can overtake"
18,"hed so that it looks
like our road would look of course the
dashed line would mean you can overtake
here which we don't know really all
right so at this point we can see that
we have the road what I'm gonna do here
now is to change this property box to
move it over to the current layer which
will be the property line there and then
we're I'm gonna explode it so I can work
on each line individually what I'm gonna
do also is to trim out this orange piece
off the road so I can see the property
boun"
19,"what I'm gonna
do also is to trim out this orange piece
off the road so I can see the property
boundary underneath so I go to the trim
tool
shrim I think this is it shrimp now I'm
gonna select this and this enter and
then we want to trim this guy out so
just like that we can now see the
property boundary underneath all right
so from here what we're gonna do is to
put our setbacks boundary in all right
so for this drawing of a dis property
the setbacks are 5 feet from the sides
both sides 15 fee"
20,"right
so for this drawing of a dis property
the setbacks are 5 feet from the sides
both sides 15 feet from the back and 20
feet from the center of the road on the
front all right now these information
again you would get from your local
authorities these are very critical
information and I will explain some more
later on in this video so what I'm gonna
do is to do some more offsets again
notice we using the offset to very
regularly here so we're gonna offset 15
feet
on the back okay then it's go"
21,"using the offset to very
regularly here so we're gonna offset 15
feet
on the back okay then it's gonna be
another offset which would be five feet
on the sides all right just like that
and then it should be twenty feet from
the center of the road so let's do
another offset twenty feet from the
center line that is why we needed the
centerline
all right so in Jamaica they use the
centerline at the front of the building
or the front of the property I'm not
sure if that's how they do it in other
cou"
22,"ront of the building
or the front of the property I'm not
sure if that's how they do it in other
countries but the reason for this is so
that if in the future the government
decides to widen the street everyone on
this particular street would have the
the amount of space necessary for that
future development all right so this is
very important as we can see here is
that we have a space within the property
all right I'm gonna actually highlight
this space using the setback layer that
we created e"
23,"property
all right I'm gonna actually highlight
this space using the setback layer that
we created earlier so I'm gonna use a
setback layer and I'm gonna go to
polyline and draw just an outline around
this space
like so enter and then I'm gonna
actually delete or erase these guys now
cuz I don't need them anymore
alright enter so here we have the red
box telling us that we can only build
within these boundaries even though you
have your whole property you buy your
land but guess what you're only"
24,"ese boundaries even though you
have your whole property you buy your
land but guess what you're only allowed
to build within the sandbox and this is
very important and there are many
reasons all right for this particular
property let's say you have a river
running behind it if you watch the video
on how to draw this you would have seen
that there's a river running behind here
and so they want to ensure that you
build far away enough because if the
river should let's say take away a piece
of the"
25,"nsure that you
build far away enough because if the
river should let's say take away a piece
of the land then your house would be
safe alright we explain the front
already and also on the sides they want
to make sure that you have adequate
space away from the boundary so that
your neighbor you're building the
sapphic your neighbor and vice versa so
it's different in other areas those in
some areas you're allowed to build as
close to the to the boundary especially
if it is a condensed area like c"
26,"you're allowed to build as
close to the to the boundary especially
if it is a condensed area like cities
and so on so it all varies you just need
to find out what the setbacks are in
whatever are whichever area you're gonna
be doing the building for alright so we
need to ensure that whatever we're gonna
design can fit within this space here
and we're talking about the main
building itself so if you have another
like a accessory building that's
different that can be at least much
closer or anywh"
27,"ou have another
like a accessory building that's
different that can be at least much
closer or anywhere else on the property
for instance if you have an attached
garage or let's say a dog house our pig
pen whatever the case may be those other
things can be anywhere else but when it
comes to the main building itself it has
to be placed within
six bucks all right so this is where
part 1 of this video would end this is
what you would do before you start to
draw anything alright so let's move over
i"
28,"o would end this is
what you would do before you start to
draw anything alright so let's move over
into the second half of this video all
right so now that we have everything
here and we have the set back and what
I'm gonna do is to place the building
inside of the setback area all right but
first let me connect these back together
so I'm gonna use the join command and
let's join these guys back together so I
can get like a single object like that
good alright so we're going to go over
to our pr"
29,"ogether so I
can get like a single object like that
good alright so we're going to go over
to our project navigator
and with an xref the ground floor into
this drawing alright so over here we can
see that we have the ground floor and
what I'm gonna do is - I don't want to
move this drawing because this is an X
reference file try not to move this all
right what I'm gonna do is to move all
of this over to the building so I'm
gonna say all right use a move tool and
I'm gonna move it from this edge"
