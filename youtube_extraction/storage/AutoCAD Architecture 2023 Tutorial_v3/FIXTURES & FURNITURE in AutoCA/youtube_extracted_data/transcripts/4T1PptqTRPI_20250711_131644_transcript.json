  "full_text": "hi so this is episode 10 of our one-bedroom house series and in this video today what we're gonna do is to install some fridge so my plans is you know some some some equipment and thing inside our house today but this is probably the easiest thing and probably the most fun thing to do and yeah let's get right into it [Music] okay now the areas of focus for this video will be the kitchen and the bathroom since these areas are needed in order to submit your drawings now I hear you ask the question why the kitchen and the bathroom now these areas will have fixed or what we call stationary items that will not move for years or if ever things like cabinet stove fridge counters stuff like those also we will need to do a drainage plan which means that we need to show where the drain line runs from the kitchen and the bathroom to the sewage are the waste water system all right so these are needed in order to complete your drawing the other areas such as bedroom living room and those other areas are not as important since the items in these areas are not necessarily stationary you know you can rearrange the living room you can rearrange your bedroom but the kitchen and the bathroom can really move anything around really not to say that you should add like a bed or a couch in those areas but it's not a requirement by the state get nothing anyways I know you've been waiting so you know what let's stop talking and let's get right into it okay so as you can see on this drawing that I have prepared ahead of time this is how we want to arrange our fixtures and furniture to look something like this as you can see I have provided some instructions for you where to find each of these items within the content browser so if you follow these instructions you will be fine and you can also explore the content browser to find other things that you might like and want to try out alright so without further ado let's get cracking so we could actually add these items in this drawing right here alright so currently we're in the ground floor drawing we could add everything inside here but I don't want us to do that I want us to create a brand new drawing and add the fixtures in those drawing just like we did with the foundation we have the foundation in a separate drawing let me show you that so we have the foundation in a separate drawing we have the ground floor in a separate drawing now we're going to add the fixtures and furniture in a separate drawing how by creating a brand new construct so let's do that alright so we go down to new now we say construct and we're gonna call this fix chairs or furniture whatever you want to call it you can give it a description if you want whatever and then we would select what level do we want these items to be added to we're gonna say of course the ground floor we're not gonna add them to the foundation that would be crazy and we could go ahead and open the drawing so as we click OK you can see that a brand new drawing was created for us to add these items in but how can you add them when you can't even see the house itself to know where to place each item and guess what that's where we go over here and we're gonna xref overlay into this drawing so again go to the ground floor right click go down to x-ray overlay and just like that we have the ground floor inside of our fixtures drawing alright now this comes in as a block by itself we cannot do any edits to this inside of this and that's amazing so let me minimize this and what I'm gonna do is to pull this over to this side so I can have the drawing over here as a reference so we can look at it together alright so the first thing we're gonna do is to add our base cabinets and then we're gonna add the wall cabinets second and then we add the stove fridge sink and then count it up so that's the order in which we're going to be doing things so the first thing I want to do is to go to your content browser and we would go into imperial as usual if you're doing metric this is where you would go so we're going to be going to imperial and following the instructions on the sheet we would go to furnishing and we go to furniture sorry let's go back we're going to casework and the first base cabinet we're gonna add is from this category and it would be 24 inches wide which would be this guy right here so when I drop in drop it right here alright so we have our first cabinet installed let's take a look at it cuz I know you're curious doesn't know what this thing looks like so that's what it looks like in the corner over there and we're gonna keep adding them coming around like that so let's go back to the top view I so we're going to be adding the second one which is a 12-inch one with some drawers inside of it so know what the keys work and we're gonna go base with jars and this is it insert and just like that we drop it right here so it's almost like we're placing building blocks on top of each other the third one is gonna be the big one which will house the sink so we're going to go back to casework and this one will not have any drawers on it so go back to base cabinet and this one should be 36 inches wide so I'm going to insert that one and we're gonna drop him right there just like that I don't know if you realize how easy this is then we're gonna go and drop in a corner one right here alright it is important that you layout your kitchen and your bathroom before you start to do this have an idea what you're doing so that when you start to work you can work smoothly so we're going to be dropping the corner one we're going to the corner folder and we have a corner base which is what we're going to be adding so we would drop it here again but guess what it is in the wrong orientation so we need to rotate this one 270 degrees just like that we can don't drop it in the corner right here so now we have one side completed we're gonna drop in next one here which is a thirty inch wide with drawers so we need to go here and we need to find thirty inch with drawers and again all of these will need to be rotated 270 degrees and we're gonna drop it right there and then lastly we have one in the corner here which is a 12-inch one so here it is insert and we're gonna rotate it alright so now we could place it but guess what the cursor is on the wrong side so I'm gonna click and drop it first and then I'll move it over using the move tool to place it in a corner like that so there we now have our base cabinet if you want to see what it looks like of course we could just do like that and you can see them in the background there alright let's go back to the top view alright so we're going to add the wall cabinets no before I add those if you notice I am not seeing the windows on this side and if you remember in a previous video I would have shown you how to see your windows I'm gonna be doing it again so we would go to what is called a global quarter plane and we would actually just raise this number up to four feet six inches and that should be good to show those windows we want to know where exactly the wall cabinet should stop for this drawing I wanted to stop on the edge of the window okay so from the corner of the wall to the edge of the window which is 24 inches if I should measure it not 24 30 inches rather right 2 feet 6 inches that would equal to 30 inches so we need something that is 30 inches wide so let's go back and go to casework and at the top here we will find all of our wall cabinets we have some that are sharp and some that are tall depending on where you want to place it you know you have some short ones above the stove or above the refrigerator that kind of thing I'm gonna be sticking with the regular 30-inch ones and we need one that is 30 inches wide as well so I'm gonna insert it just like this we can drop it right in the corner of the window like that and that's good and then we're gonna drop our second one down here in this corner right here so just like that we have our wall cabinets installed all right so if I should go back to 3d you can see them here actually you know what let's go to our X reference palette and if you don't know where this is you can go to this paperclip icon down here or type the command X ref and it would bring you to this palette now what we can actually do is to hide the house itself so let's go to unload the house and just like that we can focus on the furniture themselves all right and we're gonna do this for the remainder of the kitchen well maybe not know let's turn it back on reload go back to top view I'm gonna add the stove and the refrigerator now so let's go back to here and we're gonna go to to log and we're gonna go equipment foodservice range we're gonna add this one inside so let's go to insert into our drawing and then I'm gonna rotate it I'm trying to move as quickly as possible because I don't want is we need to be too long alright so click on it I'm gonna move it into its position so move it from here to there alright and then we're gonna be adding the sink over here well before we add this thing let's add the refrigerator cause I think it's in the same place here refrigerator we want to add this one insert you need to rotate this one 90 degrees and we're gonna drop it right on this wall right there looks just about good and lastly we need to add the sink so let's go back to catalog mechanical plumbing sink and this is the one that I want to use you can go ahead and choose the one that you would prefer this is a small house so I'm gonna choose a single sink and I'm gonna drop it right in the middle right there okay alright so what I'm gonna do is to go back to 3d and I'm going to unload the house so that we can focus on just these items now if you'll notice I'm put it in concept well we do not have a countertop that's because you have to create your own called the top alright and also if you notice the sink is on the floor which is nuts alright so what we need to do is to move the elevation of the sink up to 3 feet all right so just like that we have the sink coming up as you can see we would add our countertop to flush with the sink on top of there all right so we're gonna do that now let's go back to our top view and 2d wireframe at this point I don't need to reload the house so I'm gonna just work with it like this the same tool that we used to draw the floor is the same tool we're gonna be using to draw our countertop and the reason for that is with a slab you can make it any material you want that's how other card works so we can make it granite we can make it plastic we can make it would we can make it whatever you want so we're gonna use the slab tool as you can see right here and we're gonna make sure that it is 2 inches thick and everything else looks like this over here and then we're gonna go ahead and start to draw our way around so let's start at this corner we're gonna go this way make our way around I'm gonna go back here when you reach the sink we want to go around the sink so let's do that going around the sink and we're gonna click right here enter alright now we're gonna add another one over here enter and just like that we have our countertops so let's look at that again in 3d now as you can see our countertops are at the bottom of the the thing again which is crazy so what do you think we need to do we need to raise the elevation so let's do that over here elevation three feet so the height of a countertop is typically three feet so that is why we put the elevation at three feet so now you can see that our sink is lying nice and flush on top of the countertop and everything is looking premium proper the only issue we have now is that the countertop should have a overhang let me show you so this piece the countertop should be hanging over a little bit into the kitchen so that's the only thing that we have left to fix here in the kitchen let's go back to 2d and it's easy to fix all we need to do is to click on the countertop itself now we're gonna drag this arrow out like so and we're gonna type to enter just like that it is now two inches hanging over the cabinets alright we're gonna do the same thing with this just click on the arrow drag it out type two - we're gonna do the same thing here - alright so I don't know if you can see it but I'm gonna put it in 3d concept well so now you can see that we have a slight overhang of the countertop over the cabinet and that's exactly what we want so our kitchen is done all we need to do now is to add our bathroom elements so I'm gonna be doing that at this point I'm gonna kind of speed you up so because you kind of get the ID and the gist of what's happening here what I'm gonna do is to reload the house so that we can see where the bathroom is so that we can place our items so we're gonna go back to content browser and we're already in the plumbing section of the hardware so first thing we need to add is a toilet and we're gonna use this one you can choose the one that you want to use I'm using this one and of course we need to rotate it so let's do that over here 270 degrees and I'm gonna drop him okay I did not mention this before but this bathroom is what we call a wet bathroom which means that the entire bathroom area in inside of this space here is the shower area so there is no bathtub and that kind of thing the entire room is the shower area even though the toilet is in there still alright so if you don't know what a wet bathroom is you can actually Google it up and see some other examples so what we're gonna do is add a shower header right here let's go back to the content browser go to plumbing and we go to shower and we have a showerhead right here so we're gonna be dropping him right on this wall just for just about here and of course we're gonna raise the elevation from zero because right now it is on the floor from zero to about eight feet I think eight feet is a good height I'm gonna be adding a drain in the middle here or wherever you want to add yours so go back to plumbing drain floor drain I'm gonna be dropping it right in the center here this might not be the best location let me drop it over to this side so that's our dream and lastly let's add our lavatory affection let me call this basin so let's go back to plumbing and we go to lavatory and inside here we can find different types of facepiece okay we can we have these that doesn't have a base and of course we could add a base to it just like we did with the kitchen so you'd go to cabinet and find a nice cabinet to place it on what we're going to find one that I already have everything which is this one right here I'm gonna just drop it in the dryer make life a little easier for this video all right now we're gonna drop it right in the center of that wall and just like that we have everything placed for the bathroom and the kitchen so let's look at that in 3d and of course I'm gonna hide the house so that we can focus on these guys right here we have the showerhead we have the toilet and we also have for face basin so everything is looking good for these areas and as I said before these areas are the two most important areas that we must complete in order to complete a drawing so bear that in mind I'm not going to be doing the other areas I'm going to leave
