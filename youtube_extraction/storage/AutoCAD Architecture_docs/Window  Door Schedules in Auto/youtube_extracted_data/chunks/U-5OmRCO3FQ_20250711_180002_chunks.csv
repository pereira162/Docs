0,so today we are pulling back the curtains and dive into the world of windows and door schedules and of course as Architects and designers we often times will need to do windows and door schedules for many reasons that we'll talk about a little bit later but you got to stay around to the end because I'm going to be showing you how to add icons or images to your schedule to make them look something like this so what I'm saying and so yeah you're going to be able to add uh images and icons to your schedule and make them Stand Out Above the Rest so stay tuned for that let's go so Windows Ando schedules are perhaps the two schedules that you will always need to have on your architectural designs and these schedules do play a crucial role in the life cycle of uh the project and so uh it provides organization and Clarity consistency uh cost estimation is one of the big parts of having schedules in general but more so windows and door schedules since that's what we're focusing on today uh we t,0,1000,1000,191,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
1,in general but more so windows and door schedules since that's what we're focusing on today uh we talk about efficient communication and also uh construction guidance you know the contractor will need to know okay uh when I'm building this door I need to make the uh height that and the width that and so on and so forth now why would you want to add images or icons to your schedules a couple of uh reasons of course it does improve communication and it makes uh for a professional look and most of all it makes your schedule user friendly all right immediately as you look at the schedule you kind of know what you're looking at rather than having to think too deeply you just know okay this is the entry door this is the byold door and so on and so forth and so these type of schedules really do add that extra push or professional look to your drawings all right so let's dive into that over into AutoCAD here all right so here we are in AutoCAD Architecture and this is the floor plan that we'l,900,1900,999,192,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
2,o AutoCAD here all right so here we are in AutoCAD Architecture and this is the floor plan that we'll be working with I will provide links in the description if you want to follow along uh where you can download these uh drawings and also the PDF that was uh shown a little bit earlier however as you can see here I have this nice little floor plan going on with some windows as you can see there I do have some doors and so on and so forth I have also added spaces into my drawing and you'll see that these spaces will become important a little bit later especially when we want to determine where in the building these windows and doors are located okay now remember I have a video on schedules already as a I think it's a pretty good video that will teach you how to create schedules from scratch okay how to build each property or parameter and how to enter information into those parameter all of that stuff and those techniques can be used regardless of the object that you are uh creating the,1800,2800,999,192,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
3,f that stuff and those techniques can be used regardless of the object that you are uh creating the schedule for so whether it be Windows Doors walls um roof slab stairs anything that you're creating as scheduled for the same principles apply and the same thing applies to this video um the things that I show you here can be applied to other objects within your project okay so that being said I will not be starting from scratch here I'm going to just pick a schedule one of the templates that were provided with the software so um how do we find that we go home we go to uh the tool drop down here and we click on style browser and that's going to pop out this little thing here this palette and at the top you want to go all the way down to where it says schedule table and in here AutoCAD would have provided some samples for us to use and so we can just pick uh you know anyone from the from the list however why don't we go over over here instead and we do have window schedule and door schedu,2700,3700,1000,199,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
4,e list however why don't we go over over here instead and we do have window schedule and door schedule here so I think I'd rather use these ones instead of those CU these come with a bunch of stuff so we click on door schedule there and it ask us to select the objects or hit enter to uh to begin what we can do is to just highlight the whole drawing like this and it will filter out the doors as you can see all the doors are selected there and we would hit enter and it starts to build a schedule and it is now asking us to place this somewhere now before we place it in our properties we could determine the scale here now I would recommend leaving the scale cuz the number that it places here is based on the scale that you're using and the this number is appropriate for the scale so if you had a halfin scale or 1/8 of an inch scale that number would be different but if you're using a quarter inch scale like I am doing here the number 48 is the actual number that you want to have so we're go,3600,4600,1000,205,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
5,inch scale like I am doing here the number 48 is the actual number that you want to have so we're going to leave that as is and we're going to just include we're going to click here and then once you make your first click you just hit enter and there you have it so this is our door schedule and why don't we do one for the window same time all right so we're going to do the same thing swipe select it will highlight all the windows in your drawing and then of course we'll hit enter once more and we're going to drop this on the side here click hit enter and we have our Windows all right so what we're going to do here is to edit each of these schedule to remove the columns that we don't want and also to add the columns that we need all right and uh even though some of these columns are not yet available we're going to create them and and I'll show you how to do that so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to click on the first schedule which is the door schedule here and I'm going to say,4500,5500,1000,208,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
6,ere is I'm going to click on the first schedule which is the door schedule here and I'm going to say edit style and you want to go over to the columns tab right here and then of course we have a bunch of columns that we don't need so all you got to do is to highlight them by holding down the control key on your keyboard and then clicking on each of these things right here I think I'm going to keep fire rating for the door that's fine uh if it's something you'll need to show but uh just for this example I'll keep it there and then I think that's it for doors I'm going to hit delete right here and then hit okay and so all of those are gone and then I can proceed to to adding a column that I need so I'm going to add and then I can scroll through the list that is available now if something is not available here we will have to go in and add that property to the uh to the door and so um as you will see here um we do have style so here it is but the other one which would be uh location is mi,5400,6400,1000,215,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
7,u will see here um we do have style so here it is but the other one which would be uh location is missing we're not going to be adding elevation because this would only apply if you have multiple story uh building so since it's just a flat building we're going to leave that one out but for the location we want to uh apply this one but it's not yet available or maybe it is let's see so we're going to add a style which we just did right here and we're going to hit okay and you can see that the style was added now I don't like where it is located right now hold on let me see something here okay yeah I think it's in the right spot so I have Mark first and then style and then I have the size fire rating then I want to have location like right after fire rating so I could go to add and in order to add location uh let me see that that's not showing up in here is it it's not so in order to add location we'll have to uh go into our style manager and do some little things in there as well as we,6300,7300,999,213,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
8,ocation we'll have to uh go into our style manager and do some little things in there as well as we don't have a column for our icons so we're going to be able to create uh two uh properties one for location and one for our icons okay so we have icon and location all right so we're going to hit okay for now cuz our canc rather and then hit okay here and you will see that your schedule has now been updated with the mark number the style the size fire rating such and so forth why don't we do the same for the window for now so let's go into window over to the column uh tab here and then we will delete these two columns and then I'll add style here so go down to style okay and then we will also need location and icon here so we're going to hit okay so this is what we have so far so so far so good yeah why don't we go now and try to add the location and the image now let's start with location because as you can see here I do have spaces within my drawing and if you don't know what these are,7200,8200,1000,212,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
9,because as you can see here I do have spaces within my drawing and if you don't know what these are I do have another video that talks about spaces and how to create them and what they are what they do all of that stuff but um if you click on one of these windows you'll see this little thing out here called Property Data location and anywhere this thing is located for any of your objects um uh your window or door will tell the program or the software that it's located within that space okay so for example this window has its location Point inside of this room so in your properties it will report that the location of this window is in bedroom number one and that applies to any of these object objects so if I click on this door it's going to tell me that it is in the master bedroom because the uh location point is in that room however guess what you can move it I can move it from one room to the next or I can move it to even another space of course that wouldn't make sense to move your,8100,9100,998,201,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
10,to the next or I can move it to even another space of course that wouldn't make sense to move your location for this door all the way up there but just so you know what that is and so that's what that does so how do we add added to our property over here because all of the properties I'm going to refresh this right here now all of the properties that we see within our schedule is being pulled from the door or the window object within your properties here so if you notice you have the style the width the height all of these information it's really what we're pulling out in our schedule so what we need to do is to add location to the list and we want to add the icon to the list as well okay let's begin with location so the first thing we're going to do is to go to the manage Tab and then to style manager and in here we have all the styles that are available in your project so we're going to go down to documentation go down to property set definition and we will click on uh windows style,9000,10000,999,203,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
11,to go down to documentation go down to property set definition and we will click on uh windows style or rather I tell you what for location we're going to create a new property set so we're going to right click and say new and we're going to say allcore object objects location okay let's put it let's do it like that okay so that's our new style reason why I create a new one here is because I want to be able to apply this to every single object cuz at some point I might need to use this for walls or for you know some objects within a room something of that sort so I just do all objects now of course if I wanted to apply this to one particular object I would rename it to that for example these other ones that you see down here you know it's called wall Styles because it only applies to walls same thing for doors windows and so on you would try to name it uh to be similar to the object that you are trying to apply to but since we're going to do all objects here I call it that and you go o,9900,10900,1000,207,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
12,you are trying to apply to but since we're going to do all objects here I call it that and you go over to the second tab here and you would say objects right here okay and then you would say select all because I do want this to be applied to every single object okay then I go over to definition and this is where I am able to create the property that I want to show up in the properties palette okay so for this one I'm going to go down to what is called add location property definition so if you watch my previous video on schedule we would have talked about the first two and I don't think we touched on format maybe in a later video but today we're going to be looking at location property so we click on that and in here I'm going to call this property location and then what we want to do since we're going to be using the space object to uh to identify the location of these things we're going to click on the space drop down there and we're going to click on Space object and if you notice,10800,11800,998,203,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
13,ng to click on the space drop down there and we're going to click on Space object and if you notice what you're seeing here space objects is actually a property set definition that was created by AutoCAD now I didn't create this AutoCAD created it so it's living in my project and that's these are the properties that are within your spaces here okay so what we're doing is to pick the name of the space okay and we're going to hit okay just like that and and then for description let me see if I can change the description here use property name for description I'm going to uncheck that and hit okay and I should be able to edit this to be location okay so that's what I want there location location and then over in your format you can tell it how you want it to be shown in your schedule uh let's keep it at uppercase and we'll leave it at that and we hit okay okay so now that we have created that property we can apply to all of our windows and all of our doors so if I highlight everything in,11700,12700,999,199,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
14,at property we can apply to all of our windows and all of our doors so if I highlight everything in my drawing and I filter down to doors it's not there as yet but if I click on this button it will become available okay and I'll check that box and I'll click on okay and now location is available now it it says varies because I have multiple doors selected I'm going to filter down to Windows and I'm going to do the same thing I'm going to add the location hit okay and our schedules are now obsolete so we need to refresh so we're going to update and that's fine nothing has changed because we haven't added those columns in as yet but guess what if you click on one of these windows you can see that the location has been populated with the name of the space that it is adjacent to so you can see and that's because it has the location Point within that room okay so same thing for this one this one is reading the master bedroom but we could have put it in the master bath if we move this point,12600,13600,999,201,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
15,one is reading the master bedroom but we could have put it in the master bath if we move this point over you can see that the location is now in the master bathro likewise so one of the things you would want to do is to go through and make sure that uh all of your location points are in the place that you want them to be for example I think this one here was kind of pointing over here uh by default you know so this one is saying in bedroom number two but really and truly it should be in closet number one so I kind of just moved it uh over a little bit so you'll have to make some minor adjustment here and there but nonetheless pretty cool stuff and uh we're going to update these so now all that is left is for us to add this to our schedule yeah so we edit Style again you know the drill by now we go to add a column and now location becomes available uppercase that's all good we hit okay it is added to the end I'm going to just pull it over one notch and that's what it is and I'm going hi,13500,14500,1000,211,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
16,is added to the end I'm going to just pull it over one notch and that's what it is and I'm going hit okay so now the location is added to my uh my schedule now this is showing entry door and not sure let me see something entry door okay so one of my doors is not in the right spot okay so what happened is that I did not add the property to this door and this is a this is not a door per se uh this is considered a door window assembly so if I do a object viewer you'll see what this looks like it's a kind of an assembly with a window and a door in the middle so what we need to do is to apply that property as well to this object and then it should show up in our schedule so I'm going hit update and then that should be good and then let's add the same column to our Windows schedule so I'm going to go to edit style here I'm going to say add column I'm going to click on location I'm going to say okay and of course I'm going to drag it into the appropriate location and the last thing I want to,14400,15400,999,216,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
17,y okay and of course I'm going to drag it into the appropriate location and the last thing I want to do to my windows schedule here is to remove the door window assembly cuz if you remembered a while ago this is already showing up in my door schedule so I don't want to see this in my windows schedule the only thing I want to see here is Windows and so I'm going to turn this off and hit okay and so what it did there was to remove one of those items from my Windows schedule but it is still existing over here so that's fine and so now we have all the loow location for each of our Windows how cool is that yeah if you all like this video do me the Hunter and hit the Subscribe button if you learn something new already you know the drill all right respect and manners um but yeah that's how you get your location into your drawing now let's go ahead and add uh add your icons or images to your schedule now this one is very time consuming so I have gone ahead and put some stuff together uh I kind,15300,16300,1000,205,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
18,edule now this one is very time consuming so I have gone ahead and put some stuff together uh I kind of want to show you what I have here so if you notice I have a folder here with images of all the windows and doors in this project already okay so one of the things you'll need to do is to create images of each Window and Door within your project and so I would have gone through and you know have done this already but I'll go ahead and show you a real easy way way to do this actually it's pretty pretty cool so if you click on one of these objects um you just click on it like that click on your object viewer and in here you can rotate the window or door or whatever object you're trying to look at and you can place it in the orientation that you would like play around with the uh visual Styles and the details and so on and so forth forth uh you can just play around with these maybe you want to put it in wireframe or you want to put it in shaded with edges maybe you want to look at the fr,16200,17200,1000,210,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
19,t to put it in wireframe or you want to put it in shaded with edges maybe you want to look at the front view something like that or you want to see an isometric view or perhaps you want a perspective view huh how about that so whatever you prefer you can play around with these and once you're done you would hit the save button and this would allow you to save an image whether it be PNG uh gfif or jpeg bit map or this other one here that I've never used before but you simply would just save your image so let's call this a b c and I'm going to save it in my folder and then in my folder I do now have that image available to be used within my schedule now the only thing I would recommend here is that uh this particular image if you import it just as you have it here it's going to come in with a black background for some weird reason I don't know why but that that's just how it works so what you'll have to do is to edit this image just briefly go to open with paint and maybe uh you could p,17100,18100,999,210,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
20,you'll have to do is to edit this image just briefly go to open with paint and maybe uh you could p paint the background to be white so I'll do something like that just paint it white so you'll have a white background and then you'll go ahead and save it once more get out of there and now you have an image with a white background okay so you'll have to do that process for each of your object but of course the fact of the matter is it's really easy to just highlight the objects you want so for example this front door window assembly I could just do that come to this view put it in my 3D view like that you know make all the same changes right here so I'll put it shaded with edges and then I would hit save and then I'll call this XYZ and then I'll hit save and so that's the process and then once you have it in here you edit open with paint and I'm going to paint the background to be white again hit save and you exit so you have your windows and your doors saved in one location just like y,18000,19000,1000,207,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
21,gain hit save and you exit so you have your windows and your doors saved in one location just like you see I have mine here gave them the appropriate naming and all of that and once you have that then it is time to apply those to your objects in here and then to your schedules okay so what we're going to do similar to how we did location we're going to go back to the style manager we're going to go down to documentation and we're going to go to property set definition now this time we're going to create a new property okay we're going to create a new one we're going to call it all style uncore icon okay or image whatever you want to call it let's put image okay now the reason why I call it style is because this time we're going to be applying to the Styles and definitions and not necessarily the object okay cuz what happen is when I apply an image to for example this window I want that same image to be applied to every other window that is of the same style so you have to pick the styl,18900,19900,1000,202,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
22,ame image to be applied to every other window that is of the same style so you have to pick the style and definition options here if you pick object it's going to apply that property to each individual object okay so that's just a simple way to understand this so I'm going to pick all of them and if you don't want to do all you could just pick the the door and window that you want to apply this to for example you could just say um clear all door style door window assembly and then we' pick window cuz those are really the three things that we're applying this to but if I want to use this in the future on other elements or objects within my drawing then I would want to say select all and then I'd go over to definition and over here we're going to add a special type of property okay and we're going to go all the way down to graphic property definition how easy is that so you click on this button here you give it a name so we could call it icon or image whatever and at this point you will,19800,20800,999,203,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
23,utton here you give it a name so we could call it icon or image whatever and at this point you will determine whether you're going to be using a block or an image now in our case we're going to be using image and that's because we we have images okay now if you had blocks that would be amazing because I think the blocks will give you higher quality prints yeah and the blocks will come out without borders so if we go back to the PDF here and this is the downside of using images is the fact that uh it does come with this border around the edge and you can see the pixelation of the image but when you zoom out it doesn't look that bad you know I don't think it look that bad now if you have the time to create blocks for each of these windows and each of these doors that's that's awesome I wish there was a oneclick button that I could just click and it would just create the block for me I'm sure there's a way to write a a a code or a program to do that but I honestly don't know how to do tha,20700,21700,1000,209,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
24,re there's a way to write a a a code or a program to do that but I honestly don't know how to do that so I just stick with images for now give it a name and uh that's it really that's it um we're not going to select an image here we're just going to hit okay and that's the property it's called icon or let's rename it object icon whatever we hit okay and so we're going to select again everything and uh this time actually what we need to do since it's a style uh definition we will go into our architectural object Styles here and we're going to apply to each of our Styles in here because this time we won't be able to apply uh this property outside here because these properties are object properties if you notice door object object location only object properties can be applied out here if you want to apply style properties then you would have to go into your edit style and then add that property in here so if I click on this you'll see that nothing is in here but I'll have to add it and y,21600,22600,1000,201,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"

29,change it somewhere here to say update automatically so we don't have to continue to to refresh this thing any change we make to our project will just be updated automatically so that's that but you can see that the entry door has now been added in and so that looks good the only 3D image we have is this one which we kind of did on the on the last fly there but um what I want to do is to make these image a little bit bigger cuz right now they are pretty much the size of your text and so what we have to do is to go in and tell it to make this a little bit bigger so if we click on this again and go to edit style click on your icon column and then say modify and then down here we can override the cell format okay and then in the height column this is where you would type the height that you would like so for this one that I did here I did use half in um that's the paper height but um maybe we could make it a little bigger how about 5/8 yeah 5/8 let's do 5/8 that's like a notch up and then,26100,27100,1000,215,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
30,we could make it a little bigger how about 5/8 yeah 5/8 let's do 5/8 that's like a notch up and then we hit okay okay and then okay so as you can see those got blown up really big and they're looking wonderful yeah I like that so we could go ahead and do the same thing for our windows so I'm going to go ahead and do that and I'll of course speed through that section I don't want to have you guys hanging on for too long so I'm going to go down to my window Styles and I'm going to click on casement e so that is our window schedule looking all lovely yeah so that's beautiful so now we can actually go ahead and print these but before I print them you'll see that the numbers in here are uh well this one is not bad cuz it's counting one all the way down down to 14 but we could actually rumber these schedule and this is another awesome technique that you're going to be learning right now so why don't we go ahead and tag our windows and doors let's go ahead to annotate we'll do door tags okay,27000,28000,999,205,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
31,don't we go ahead and tag our windows and doors let's go ahead to annotate we'll do door tags okay so I'll pick one door first let's pick a door let's put our tag right here and then we'll hit okay and then we'll do multiple and then swipe all of our doors hit enter it's going to ask you if you want to retag the one that we did before we're going to say no and then we're going to hit okay so what that did there was to tag every single door within our project um including these ones here so I'm going to move these out a little bit move these down like so and then move this one up maybe like right there all right so you can see the each number for each door in here and uh these numbers are counting from 14 all the way down I don't know why it started at 14 but we can uh actually rum those by going to the scheduling drop down here and say reum property set and you have the ability to renumber any of these things um for this particular instance we want to re number our doors so let's do t,27900,28900,999,208,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
32,ber any of these things um for this particular instance we want to re number our doors so let's do that reum and you put your starting number and your increment you want to go up every one or every two or every three so on and so forth and we're going to hit okay and so we can start with what we want door number one to be so for example I could make this door number one door number two I'm going to keep going around door number three four five six and you just keep going yeah okay so we have 14 doors instead of 27 and if you go over here you'll see that your doors have been Reed numbered and have been reshuffled in the order that you have numbered them okay and so that's how that is done and you can do the same thing with your windows so if we say window tag we pick our first window maybe this one here we hit okay and then we say multiple and then we swipe the whole building hit enter then no then okay all of our Windows have been tagged I'm going to remove this one cuz this have alrea,28800,29800,1000,207,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
33,en no then okay all of our Windows have been tagged I'm going to remove this one cuz this have already been tagged and then so now we can see which number is is relating to which uh window so window number one is a picture Round And if we look we have window number one window number two is the other one and that would be window number two so on and so forth so now all that is left is for us to apply these to our drawing and so what we're going to do here is go over to my schedule sheet cuz I do have my floor plan sheet already set why don't I move this down a little bit in the middle yeah I'm going to go over to my schedule and I'm going to draw a rectangle right here and then I'm going to zoom into my schedules like so and of course I want to set the appropriate scale so I'm going to make it/ qu inch now that's big let me move these over so I'll need to create uh I could do either I could create two separate view window or I could simply go over to my model space and move this one ove,29700,30700,1000,214,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
34,ld create two separate view window or I could simply go over to my model space and move this one over a little bit closer to that one which I think is the best way to do it and so on my sheet it reflects that change and then I can reshape my window to the size of my schedule and then last but not least we will put this box on the dep point layer so that it becomes invisible when I print it okay so there's a layer in here called def points and uh that layer does not print that's because in your properties layer properties over here if you look the def point layer is turned off the printer is unavailable so it will never show up on a sheet so if we do a print make sure that my settings are all set monochrome da da da apply and then I'll do a preview you can now see that uh everything is com out looking wonderful beautiful again the only issue I have with this technique is the line going around each image and I have tested a bunch of things uh including turn trying to turn the lines white,30600,31600,1000,205,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
35,ound each image and I have tested a bunch of things uh including turn trying to turn the lines white which actually worked but the same layer that is used to create that line is the same layer that is used for these other lines and so when you make it white everything becomes white and so you have no border which is kind of kind of crazy I wish it I wish you could control those layers differently or maybe there is a way to do it and so if you know how to do that please please share with me I would love to learn how to do that but I have tested a bunch of things again if you're looking to get higher quality images on your schedule um you could create create blocks for each of these and again that's even more time consuming than uh than just using these images I don't I don't know if it is that serious for you to go and create blocks I would love for somebody to write a code if you all know how to do that stuff a code whether through Dynamo or through the lip or something like that I don,31500,32500,1000,205,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
36,w how to do that stuff a code whether through Dynamo or through the lip or something like that I don't know them all like that but um if you do know how to do that I would love to uh create a a tool or a add-on or a button that I could just click on and it would just do it for me but uh but yeah that would be awesome but right now this is what we have and so when you print this out of course why don't we just print it out and see what we get so I'm going to hit okay here and it's going to ask me for a location I'm going to just drop it in the same folder here and then it's going to open up in inside of adobe okay so yeah this is what we have guys I think it looks wonderful so thank you again for watching this video I do hope that you learned something new and if you did please feel free to hit the Subscribe button and also if you haven't as yet check out my course on articad architecture,32400,33400,900,196,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
