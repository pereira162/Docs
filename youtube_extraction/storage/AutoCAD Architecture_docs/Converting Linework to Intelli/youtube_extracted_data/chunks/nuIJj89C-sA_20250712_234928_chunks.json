In this exercise we're going to convert Linework to intelligent Walls using the AutoCAD Architecture Toolset looking up this sample floor plan that was sketched up in AutoCAD we can take the AutoCAD Architecture Toolset and it's advantages by applying the create a wall object from the Tool Palettes  right-click on it and choose \"Apply tool Properties to > Linework\"  then select the Linework the this example we are selecting the outer perimeter Walls and all the load bearing Walls in this floor plan and I'm going to confirm my selection with the Enter key and the first prompt that we get is \"Erase the layout geometry\" which means to either erase ot keep the Linework that was selected the default option is \"No\" which means to keep the linework which we are choosing in this example  now we can see that the Walls have been created with the justification of the Walls in the middle and we are going to adjust the justification to the left, so the Walls are positioned from the outer perimete",
