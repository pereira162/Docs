  "full_text": "all right so here we are back with another video on the channel and recently i placed a poll asking you guys which topic you'd like me to cover in my next video and most persons voted for the staircase in autocad architecture so that's what this video will be about today however i thought the other topics got some good numbers too so i think we will try to cover those in future videos [Music] so if it's your first time on the channel thank you for joining it's a pleasure to have you here and if you haven't subscribed as yet definitely hit the subscribe button drop a like if you learned something in this video so in this video i'll be showing you how to create staircase in autocad architecture so fortunately if you're using autocad architecture there is a stair tool that makes it easy for us to create stairs and that tool is located right here underneath the home tab it is also available in your tool palette so if you go down to the design tools and go into tool palette and then at the top here you should see a design tab mine is no missing in action i don't know where it went but i hope to figure it out someday but you should set design tab at the top here and if you scroll through the list you should see stairs in there as well all right this tool is actually a pretty flexible tool we can create some pretty customizable stairs from it however when it gets to more exotic stairs like these you know you're gonna have to do those manually um of course you could use a simple stairs from the stair tool to give you like a reference stairs to work with it will tell you how many steps you need and how wide your threads would be and so on and so forth but when it comes down to getting those fancy shape and fancy design you're gonna have to do that manually all right now in this video i will be creating stairs using this stair tool here such as a street flight l-shaped u-shaped and spiral and also i would like to show you guys if time allows how i would add a staircase inside of this two-bedroom house i do have both floors open up right here so this is the first floor where i have this little space right in here where i would like to add a street flight going up and over the powder room and going up into the second floor and landing somewhere into the passage here now if you're wondering how i did this where i have both floors open and then i have a 3d view i have a series of videos showing you how to start a project from scratch using the project navigator and how to create constructs how to create levels or to create views all of that is there so check the description below for that if you're interested so let's go over to our new drawing and of course you would have set up your units and everything and ready to go so let's go ahead and click on the stairs tool and right away we can see that we are active and ready to draw now before we start to draw let's go over to our properties panel and make some changes um these are the five things i would say you need to focus on when you're starting your stairs and of course when you draw a steer you can always go back and tweak it if it didn't fit or if it didn't work the way you wanted it to so that's nothing to worry about but usually i would pay attention to these five things the first thing would be the style okay now this is what the style look like and of course nobody uses that so i would recommend you tweak the style to make it your own but autocad actually comes with some style in there which we can use um so i would say go to your tool go down to style browser which i have it open up down here and if you navigate to the stairs type here you will see that we have quite a few different styles different materials such as concrete wood steel and we even have ramps so this is something that we have available to us in jamaica we normally use the concrete steers so i'm going to import this one into my project right now so all you got to do is right click import and now it is in my project so if i click on the stairs tool once more you will notice that we are now using that style which again i can switch it around if i needed to the next thing we're going to look at is the shape all right and this is important we are on the straight flight shape and of course we have spiral multi-landing u-shaped and so on i'm going to start with street flight and then we go down to the width which is also important because in jamaica i practice the minimum of three feet uh if it's a very very small house then you might be allowed to get a tad bit smaller but i generally stick with three feet minimum that's good practice if you're gonna be doing commercial buildings of course you're gonna have to make it much wider to accommodate high volume traffic and then we go down to the height which would be from level to level so from level one to level two if that distance is ten feet you need to enter that in here this is quite this is very important okay and then the last thing we go down is to the thread or tread depth 11 inches is a pretty good number to start with so we're going to leave it there i'm going to go ahead and click on our first point and this is where the step would the stairs would start from the level one and we're going up and if we notice that number right there says 18 out of 18 that means we are creating 18 stairs out of a total of 80. so you would click your second point in the direction that you want in this case i'm gonna turn my ortho mode on and i'm going to click at the top there and right away one is created and i can still go ahead and create another one if i wanted to but i'm going to escape out of that command and this is what we are left with so right away we can see that a portion of the staircase is hidden and this is how a staircase is normally represented on a floor plan so autocad is helping you out here all right now everything that is above the cutting plane of three feet six inches here this is the default cutting plane you can always change it if you need to but everything above this number is hidden and then everything below is showing let's take a look at this in 3d view and so this is what it would look like as a concrete stairs if you notice it has the wooden material on this top of it as well we can remove that um in a little bit i will do that all right so let's look at a couple of other things with this stairs when you click on it you will notice that it says here terminate with riser we can actually change this to another option which would be let's say thread or tread and if you notice at the top here it adds an extra tread and that's what it would terminate with and then um we can make a couple of other changes let's say i wanted to remove that uh wooden piece of material on top of it i could just click on it and i would edit the style and i would go over to components and this is where you can remove these two things here and you hit okay now those are gone so you're now left with this this pure concrete nothing on it um we could also change this slope if we needed the slope or not you can change it in the same settings we can say remove the sloping riser um do you want a nosing yes or no you can remove the nosing as well hit ok and now you get that traditional looking staircase and this is what we are mostly familiar with so i'm gonna leave it at that for now some other tweaks that you can make is to edit the edge of your stairs so if let's say you want to make this edge a little bit wider if you click on this little edge edit button here you will see that these turn into some arrows that you can just move around so if i want the stairs to look like that or if i wanted to widen this side of the stairs a little bit more i could always do that and then guess what that's how it looks i'm gonna undo all of that another thing we could do is to create a shape so let's create a shape for instance i want this portion of the stairs to have a have a little bulge like that i could click on the stairs and go to custom edge and say project and i want this edge of the stairs click on it to project to this line oh well it didn't work because this is not a polyline so i need to convert this into a polyline first and then i would redo that command so let me go ahead let's do that again project this edge to this polyline and hit enter and just like that that edge of the stairs is now projected out to whatever shape you decide all right so that is a pretty neat effect if you wanted to and you can always remove the custom edge if you want just remove it using the same tool and so that is how you go about doing a street flight a lot of those customization can be done to any of the shapes that you decide to use all right so let's go ahead and create another one using the uh multi landing and this comes into play if you needed to create a stairs with let's say a landing somewhere in the middle all right and landings are used where you have a long staircase where you definitely need to provide some amount of resting point so let's say we needed to fly a height of 15 feet it definitely needs some landing somewhere there if you notice the amount of steps have increased to 26 initially it was 18 so as we click anywhere i'm going to turn my author mode on and you start to move your cursor up you'll notice that the number is counting how many steps out of 26 so let's say we reach number 10 we can stop that first flight right there and then we can go ahead and create a landing and this landing can turn a corner or it can continue straight on let's turn a corner and let's say i want this landing to be four feet in length i could just type four feet enter and then the next flight would begin right there and i can add an extra couple of steps going up let's say i add another five steps or something like that i don't know and i click again and i want another landing here um i could say all right go another four feet i'm gonna make this one straight ahead and then i'm gonna just finish off the rest out here so it looks something like this and of course we can't see anything above but if we rotate it like this we can see it and see what it looks like if it is that you need to see the things here going up we can always just raise the cutting plane to maybe let's raise it to 14 feet all right and it will show you everything all the way up to 14 feet and you can see what that looks like um we can click on the stairs and we can move things around just like we were doing with that over there um you can move this up if you needed to um you can adjust the edges if you needed to you know just like we did with that one over there you can customize your edges to make it the way you want it all right and the same thing we could actually um turn this down as if it were a u-shaped steer um let's see if i could pull that off what i'll do is all right so yeah there i turn this into a u-shaped stairs and the beautiful thing about the multi-landing tool is that um if we want to say lengthen this side and shorten that side it's a matter of clicking on this arrow here and pulling it down and while i pull this down that side will get shorter and shorter and as i push it up it will get longer and longer so you can tweak the steps to get exactly what you need uh if we were to use the u-shaped because we do have a u-shaped option here it comes with the u shape right out of the box so you wouldn't have to be going through all of that but this tool comes with limitations all right i'm going to show you that so once you make your first click all you have to do is to type in the distance between each uh flight and you would basically get the desired staircase that you need all right but the the caveat with this one is that you don't get that luxury where you can pull one end and the other end gets shorter this is just a single landing u-shaped you cannot add a second landing to this or maybe you could i just don't know how to do it as yet um but with the multi-landing you can add as many landing as you need per your design all right now let's go to the spiral because i know that's one that many persons are interested in so i'm going to click on that and i'm going to switch over to spiral and of course this is what it would look like just a typical round stairs you can add your radius in all right so this is an option that wasn't given before now we can add a radius another radius is calculated from the middle of your cursor to that blue line all right so if you notice you're seeing a blue line there that's where it is being calculated two now if you want to change it to the outer circle or the inner circle all you got to do is to click on the justify and make the change here so i'm going to change it to inside and now that's what it looks like so now the calculation is saying the radius is three feet and i'm going to draw that step right here so i can basically rotate it to where i want it i'm going to place it right there and so that's what that would look like all right now what if we wanted to do one of those stairs where the spiral is wrapping around a pole or something like that it's quite simple you do the same thing let me do another one but this time you're gonna make the inner circle or the inner radius very small maybe something like three inches and so it looks something like that and then you would click and place your rotation wherever you want it and then that's basically what it would look like going up and of course the concrete style is not the best style to use here i'm going to switch it back around to the standard and of course i would also tweak this a little bit so let me put it into conceptual um as a matter of fact let's let's let's let's bring in the steel uh style here import and i'm gonna switch it over to steel all right so there that makes a little bit more sense don't it yeah however it would be really difficult to bend the steel like that i'm sure there's a guy out there who can do that let's say we don't want that i could edit this um style go to my stringer because this is the those edges would be the stringer i'm going to remove them on both sides and i'm going to leave it bare just like that and then i'm going to put a pole in the middle that is something i'll have to do manually so click on cylindrical and put in your height and width i think this was 15 feet if i'm not mistaking and then i'm gonna drop it right in the middle there so something like like that and so once i rotate now now i have a staircase with the middle there all right so that's how the spiral there would look just say like a steel stair and then guess what guys we can add a railing to these it's pretty pretty easy all you have to do is to click on the down arrow there and click on railing and all you have to do is to select the side on which you want the railing to be added so in this case i'm going to add a railing to the outer edge of this spiral stairs i'm gonna click on the outer edge and just like that the railing is added to the stairs all right let's do the same thing again i don't know if i can do it in 3d but we can try yep there we go it's not adding here let's try this one i think it's best to do it in top view so let's try that one more time there you go inner outer all right so it's just like that let me see if i can add one on the inside of this which would be nuts i don't think you need one no you don't need one on the inside now if you notice we have uh this is the default um railing style that we are looking at here um but we can change it because autocad does come with some additional styles that we can try so let's save let's see let's try just a simple one maybe this one import and i'm gonna switch this over i'm gonna actually select all of them and switch them over to that style and see how that looks so of course that is how it would look and of course you can tweak these railings again edit the style go inside of it this is something i might have to get into in more details but go ahead edit the railing you know change the width of the guard rail or the the uh the distance between each and so on and so forth and make it the way you want it uh that's all i have for today i'm gonna save this and then i am going to x that off and then we're going to go over to this drawing where i'm going to show you how i would add a straight flight stairs inside of this here all right okay everybody thank you for watching this video i know you want to see the next video so that will be linked right here this video was getting a little bit too long so i had to slice it in two and so the next part which is part two will be in the link below or right here but in the meantime thank you for watching i hope that you learned something hit the like button subscribe if you haven't already and big up to all the patrons over on my
