Looking at this sample floor plan that we have sketched up in AutoCAD, we can take the AutoCAD architecture toolset and the advantages of applying the create a wall object from the two pallets. So if you right click on it and you choose to apply properties to line work, you can then select the line work that is sketched up.",

So the default option is no which means to keep the line work and this is what I'm going to choose in this example.",
