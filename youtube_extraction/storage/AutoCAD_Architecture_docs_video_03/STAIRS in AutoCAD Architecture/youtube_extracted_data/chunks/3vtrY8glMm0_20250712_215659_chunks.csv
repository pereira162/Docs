0,all right so here we are back with another video on the channel and recently i placed a poll asking you guys which topic you'd like me to cover in my next video and most persons voted for the staircase in autocad architecture so that's what this video will be about today however i thought the other topics got some good numbers too so i think we will try to cover those in future videos [Music] so if it's your first time on the channel thank you for joining it's a pleasure to have you here and if you haven't subscribed as yet definitely hit the subscribe button drop a like if you learned something in this video so in this video i'll be showing you how to create staircase in autocad architecture so fortunately if you're using autocad architecture there is a stair tool that makes it easy for us to create stairs and that tool is located right here underneath the home tab it is also available in your tool palette so if you go down to the design tools and go into tool palette and then at the,0,1000,999,191,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
1,in your tool palette so if you go down to the design tools and go into tool palette and then at the top here you should see a design tab mine is no missing in action i don't know where it went but i hope to figure it out someday but you should set design tab at the top here and if you scroll through the list you should see stairs in there as well all right this tool is actually a pretty flexible tool we can create some pretty customizable stairs from it however when it gets to more exotic stairs like these you know you're gonna have to do those manually um of course you could use a simple stairs from the stair tool to give you like a reference stairs to work with it will tell you how many steps you need and how wide your threads would be and so on and so forth but when it comes down to getting those fancy shape and fancy design you're gonna have to do that manually all right now in this video i will be creating stairs using this stair tool here such as a street flight l-shaped u-shaped,900,1900,1000,201,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
2,video i will be creating stairs using this stair tool here such as a street flight l-shaped u-shaped and spiral and also i would like to show you guys if time allows how i would add a staircase inside of this two-bedroom house i do have both floors open up right here so this is the first floor where i have this little space right in here where i would like to add a street flight going up and over the powder room and going up into the second floor and landing somewhere into the passage here now if you're wondering how i did this where i have both floors open and then i have a 3d view i have a series of videos showing you how to start a project from scratch using the project navigator and how to create constructs how to create levels or to create views all of that is there so check the description below for that if you're interested so let's go over to our new drawing and of course you would have set up your units and everything and ready to go so let's go ahead and click on the stairs t,1800,2800,1000,199,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
3,ld have set up your units and everything and ready to go so let's go ahead and click on the stairs tool and right away we can see that we are active and ready to draw now before we start to draw let's go over to our properties panel and make some changes um these are the five things i would say you need to focus on when you're starting your stairs and of course when you draw a steer you can always go back and tweak it if it didn't fit or if it didn't work the way you wanted it to so that's nothing to worry about but usually i would pay attention to these five things the first thing would be the style okay now this is what the style look like and of course nobody uses that so i would recommend you tweak the style to make it your own but autocad actually comes with some style in there which we can use um so i would say go to your tool go down to style browser which i have it open up down here and if you navigate to the stairs type here you will see that we have quite a few different styl,2700,3700,1000,209,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
4,ere and if you navigate to the stairs type here you will see that we have quite a few different styles different materials such as concrete wood steel and we even have ramps so this is something that we have available to us in jamaica we normally use the concrete steers so i'm going to import this one into my project right now so all you got to do is right click import and now it is in my project so if i click on the stairs tool once more you will notice that we are now using that style which again i can switch it around if i needed to the next thing we're going to look at is the shape all right and this is important we are on the straight flight shape and of course we have spiral multi-landing u-shaped and so on i'm going to start with street flight and then we go down to the width which is also important because in jamaica i practice the minimum of three feet uh if it's a very very small house then you might be allowed to get a tad bit smaller but i generally stick with three feet mi,3600,4600,1000,202,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
5,ll house then you might be allowed to get a tad bit smaller but i generally stick with three feet minimum that's good practice if you're gonna be doing commercial buildings of course you're gonna have to make it much wider to accommodate high volume traffic and then we go down to the height which would be from level to level so from level one to level two if that distance is ten feet you need to enter that in here this is quite this is very important okay and then the last thing we go down is to the thread or tread depth 11 inches is a pretty good number to start with so we're going to leave it there i'm going to go ahead and click on our first point and this is where the step would the stairs would start from the level one and we're going up and if we notice that number right there says 18 out of 18 that means we are creating 18 stairs out of a total of 80.,4500,5371,870,177,"{'chunk_size': 1000, 'overlap': 100, 'mode': 'advanced'}"
