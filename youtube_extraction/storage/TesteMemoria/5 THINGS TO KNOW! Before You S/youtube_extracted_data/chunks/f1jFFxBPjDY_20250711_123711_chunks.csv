1,se I know that there are a lot of persons who would like to learn at least the basics as I only know the basics alright so thank you for joining me on this video so in today's video I'll be teaching you my method of drawing a house from start to finish print and ready to submit the project so for those of you who don't know what freshman is parish council is is the second tier of government in Jamaica well cuz I'm from Jamaica of course yeah I don't know if it's the same thing in other Caribbean,400,900,500,101,"{'chunk_size': 500, 'overlap': 100}"
2,aica well cuz I'm from Jamaica of course yeah I don't know if it's the same thing in other Caribbean countries but in Jamaica the parents deals with local affairs alright so in each price you have a local government that regulates that parish so they would be the ones that you would would approve a design before you can actually go and build it all right that being said before you can do any design at all mean to consider a couple of things actually a lot of things but I'll just shorten the list,800,1300,500,96,"{'chunk_size': 500, 'overlap': 100}"
3,n at all mean to consider a couple of things actually a lot of things but I'll just shorten the list to the minimum and these are some very important stuff at least things that I would require when a client comes to me and want me to do a project for them these are a couple of things that I need in order to start a design alright so the first one would be get the diagram of the property are the land you need the diagram alright that's what that's like that's a must where can you find this it is,1200,1700,499,103,"{'chunk_size': 500, 'overlap': 100}"
4,nd you need the diagram alright that's what that's like that's a must where can you find this it is located on the surveillance reporting so this is what the surveyors report should look like in Jamaica and this is something that your client should provide you with it has the shape of the land exact precise dimensions and it tells you where the road is it tells you your neighboring properties it tells you the coordinates of property and it also gives you the north alright so this is very importa,1600,2100,500,92,"{'chunk_size': 500, 'overlap': 100}"
5,ells you the coordinates of property and it also gives you the north alright so this is very important because you don't want to design something that after you're done everything it cannot fit on the land is it probably too big or might be too small you could have made better use of the space that you are given alright this is actually a very good good shape has some property actually shape of triangular shape some of them looks curved all right so it's very important that you bear that in mind,2000,2500,500,94,"{'chunk_size': 500, 'overlap': 100}"
6,iangular shape some of them looks curved all right so it's very important that you bear that in mind as you can see over this side there are some coordinates you can actually use these coordinates to draw the property in CAD to its exact dimensions because these were provided by the surveyor all right so I'll be doing a separate video on how to do that or how I go about doing the second thing no your setbacks and zoning regulations these are important you can get these from your parish council so a local da may call them up ask them what are the setbacks in say st.,2400,2972,571,110,"{'chunk_size': 500, 'overlap': 100}"
