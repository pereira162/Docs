  "full_text": "Music Hello everyone, welcome to the 24th and final episode on the one-bedroom house series that we have been doing on the channel. In today's video I'll be showing you how to get your sheets all set up in AutoCAD and how to print them in PDF format. So you might hear terminologies like sheet template, field text, sheet set, subsets or sheet properties, stuff like that but don't worry, I'm sure by the end of this episode you'll understand what all of that means. Now this video is going to be a long one so buckle up. What I'll do is to break this video in the parts so that you can skip to the part that you want to watch. So if that's something you want to do check the description below for the timestamps. You all said, I got you. I'll also be dropping the playlist for all the other episodes just in case you missed one or two aren't. You haven't seen it at all. Check the description. Yes, so I did enjoy making these videos and I hope that you enjoyed watching them as well and if you did comment below which ones were your favorite and if you're first I'm on a channel or if you haven't subscribed as yet, I'll sub this solid. All right, so let me stop talking and jump right into AutoCAD and show you how to do this thing. All right everybody, so here we are back in AutoCAD architecture and let's jump right into it. So as you already know we're going to be creating all of our sheets today but before I get into that I want to show you three additional views that I have created ahead of time for this video today. So I did do a location map as you can see right here. I also did some additional site information. You know just type of a little thing here and I also did some concrete notes here. Typical stuff, you know, just to make it into something we can place on the sheet. All right, now the location map actually I went on Google and I just find a spot and just take a snippet of it and as you can see I drew a box on the area and also kind of put a little text there to kind of identify the property. Also when you're doing a location map you want to make sure you have other, you know, table buildings or properties around so that persons who would like to locate the property can use those buildings as a landmark or as a references. So bear that in mind when you're going on Google to snip a photo or a snippet of that on here. Now this location map is not to scale so I'm going to actually change this from one eight to NTS because it's not done to scales so I don't want to have a scale there. Now if you notice this text up here is a little bit different from the others and that's because this is what we call a field text meaning this information is being pulled from somewhere else. All right and I'm going to show you exactly where it is being pulled from. If we go back to our project Navigator where we see the project let me come out of that project tab here and we go to the little pencil. You remember when we started this project now we did types of information in this box here to describe the project or what we say project description. And so this is exactly what is being seen out here and so by using field text we can pull various information from out of the project Navigator and other areas as well into our details or notes and also our title block which is going to be very important as we get further into this video. All right so how do you add fields when you create a text box like this one here? All you have to do in fact let me create a brand new one so let's just do our random one out here. One two are inside of the text box you are able to add a field in and so once you click on that you just need to locate the one that you want. So that particular one would fall on AEC projects and it would be the project description and then of course you can choose whether or not you want it to be uppercase or lowercase whatever. I'm not going to select any I'm going to just hit okay and there it is it included it in that text box. All right now that is important because when we go back into this settings here and we go down a little bit further where it says detail information when I click on this you will notice that I have a lot of other information in here and we're going to need to be able to pull these out into our title block. So this is something you can set up at the beginning of your project as well as at the end or wherever in the middle but wherever you choose to do it you need to have it in so that you can pull these out in your title block. So as you can see I have the address for the project the volume and volume number. This is a number that is unique to every property on the island so if we need to locate a property in the database they would just type that number in likewise with the coordinates. Every property has a coordinate client information you can go ahead and add in stuff like that and it's very simple all you have to do is to click on the plus button here to add a line and you just type what you need and if you need to delete that line which I'm actually going to do here you just click on the X and as you can see I actually added an extra folder here for architectural firm and that can be done using the folder icon here and so as you can see I added some additional information within this folder you know so I added the firm's name address telephone number and email and also for some fun we added the YouTube and Instagram and Twitter as well as some architect notes. Guys go ahead and add all the information that you're going to need in this box here so that we can use them later when we need them. Alright so I'm going to access off now and we're going to stay in this property setting here we're going to scroll down to where we see sheet template. Now if you remember when we had created this project back in episode I think it was episode two we did select this template here as our sheet template okay and we also selected this size as the size that we're going to be using for this project of course if you're doing a larger project you would want to select a larger page. Now this sheet template does not have in the correct type to block that we would need to use it's not customized this template is just the default one that comes with AutoCAD and so what you're going to want to do is to personalize that template to your liking alright and so what you'll have to do are what I would recommend that the easiest way to do is to basically just copy this template and make it your own alright so what you want to do is to find this file open this location the easiest way to do that is to copy copy that and go to your run up paste it in there and hit okay and it should take you directly to that folder and then you're going to look for this very same file alright DWT file and it would be somewhere here I think this is it just copy it and then I would X that off and then I would go to my project folder or to desk one bilron house and what I did was to create a new folder here as you can see this folder I created this one within this folder I kind of throw everything that I need that would be specific to this project such as the logo of my company the google image that I use to make the location map and as you can see I already copied that template over and I copied it one more time to make a personalized template alright so I'm going to open the original one so you can see what that looks like so you just drag it into AutoCAD but guess what I need to X these are first alright so let's do that now all right so I'm going to drag the original one in and see what that looks like so this is what it looks like and as you can see down here we have all the different page sizes and we are actually on largest one but the one we're focusing on would be the 18 by 24 and this is what it looks like you know it has in the sheet number sheet title checked by drawn by project number and so on and so forth client information project information and guess what it does have in everything though that is why I encourage you to copy this file and modify it you can go into the block itself this title block you can right click edit the block and change it of how you need it in fact what I'll do at this time is to open the one that I did for this drawing which will be this one and show you what that looks like so at the end of modifying everything this is what it looks like all right so I did keep these down here at least you know sheet number description checked by drawn by such and such but up here is where I added in all of those information that we looked at earlier in our project navigator all right so as you can see I just have some normal text box and I just used the field command here to add in all of the stuff that we need so of course we would find those underneath project details and here they are all of the same stuff that we saw earlier and we would just click on the one that we need and drop it in and just create your title block of course I brought my logo in I deleted those ugly letters and kind of put some additional stuff like the sheet size and plot date of course you could put the plug date in there to show the particular date in which the drawing has been printed all right and so when we start to create sheets all of our sheets will come in looking like this and these information will be automatically updated if we need let's say I had the wrong YouTube name here I could change it one place and it would update on all the sheets likewise all the sheets will come with their respective sheet number their respective sheet title sheet index whatever you know drawing name project number checked by drawn by it will come with all the information that we need so go ahead modify that template make it your own I only did the 18 by 24 template I did not do these ones because I didn't need them at this time so of course if you are running a little company or if you are even running a massive firm you know you would probably want to have a template for all of these sheet sizes all right but for this project I only did one and so once you're done you would go ahead and say save as and you would go to here and make sure to change this to template file all right article drawing template all right and then you're going to want to find your project folder which would be in your document or to desk my projects one bedroom house one bedroom and then in the same folder that we created earlier you would save it as that new template that you would have created all right no that's that all right so now that we have created our sheet template and we have also done or views everything is ready and set to go on our sheets so let's go down to the sheet step where we will no organized all of that now if you're a familiar with the sheet set manager you will not have a problem utilizing this tab right here it's pretty much the same I would say this is the sheet set manager baked right into the project navigator so we don't have to open up the sheet set manager's tab all right if you're not familiar with a sheet set or what a sheet set is let's read what it says here a sheet set is an organized collection of sheets from several drawing files and can be published transmitted and archive as a package so a sheet set allows sheet properties sheet set properties and callouts to be automatically coordinated across the sheets in the sheet set so what we're looking at here at the top is the sheet set in fact when we started this project automatically created this sheet set for us and if you go to the project folder let me pull that up for you guys you would see that in this folder we have a sheet set file and this is where it houses all of your sheets set now within the sheet set it contains sub sets all right so think about a folder and in that folder you have other folders that categorizes the sheets within that folder so that's exactly how it works here we have the head folder here one big folder and then we break it down into various categories and then within these smaller folders we would have or drawings all right no I have created a list of drawings that I think we will need for this project I have broken them down into three categories and so I have the architectural here I have the MEP which is for mechanical electrical and plumbing even during this case I only have electrical and plumbing so that's why I just have EP there and also we have a couple of drawings that we want to put in a structural folder all right so this is how I am going to be laying out our sheet set over here so let's go ahead now unfortunately we cannot just right click and delete as you notice the delete option is unavailable so what we'll have to do is to create one sheet first and it's just a work with the software I'm not sure why I ought to cut would do something like that but what we're going to do is to create one sheet first and I'm going to create the first architecture sheet so if you notice I click on architectural I'm going to actually keep this sub set because I'm going to use it what everything is I'm going to be deleting so I'm going to create one sheet under that and this is what the dialogue box looks like so this is where we're going to be typing in the sheet number so as you see on the left side of the screen the first sheet would be a dash zero one and that would be soft perspective view and I'm going to open it all right I'm going to hit okay let me minimize this and so this is our sheet as you can see it brought in our sheet template and it also auto fields via our title or sheet number and yeah everything everything else is being auto field of course we have these two here that we will need to fill in after the fact all right as well as the sheet index and the number of sheets this this should be representing the total number sheets I have nine here but it really should be ten so we're going to have the correct that so now that we have our first sheet let's go ahead and delete these now you can see that the delete option becomes available so why not just get rid of them so that's my first sheet in the architecture folder I'm going to rename this one to be mpp and then I'm going to create one more underneath the one bedroom house here I'm going to create another subset and I'm going to call this one structure okay all right so now we have our three subsets I'm going to drag this to the top because I want architecture to be at the top and actually we have our first architectural page and so what we can do at this time is to go ahead and create all of our sheets just you know do them at once and then we can start to add our views to it so before I create any other sheet however what I want to show you also is you can right click on the sheet go to properties and you can modify the sheet index so in this case this would be sheet number one drawn by myself and then checked by whomever it is that you have checking your sheets and then once we go to the sheet and refresh type the command Re it would update all of these fields as well as putting the sheet number so sheet one off and it should be 10 here so let's go ahead and change this to 10 now in order to change it to 10 we have to go to the sheet set itself right click and go to properties and scroll down to where you see total sheets now if you're not seeing total sheets we can always add another custom property in so go ahead and add it in make sure it looks somewhat like this and you hit okay it should populate down here and we're going to change at 10 hit okay I'm going to refresh and that should change to 10 now there's a lot to be said about the sheet set custom properties and also sheet custom properties like we're seeing here you could actually create your own lines that you want to appear but that is for next video I'm not going to be going in too much details on that in this video all right so now that we have that set what I'm going to do is to go ahead and create all the other pages and I'm going to just fast forward the video to end of that all right so let's get it all right we're moving over to the MEPs now we're moving over to structural all right guys so now you can see that I have all 10 sheets created here perfectly what I'm going to do now is to go through and enter the drawn by check by information and also the sheet index so if you remember we went to properties and this would be sheet number two drawn by myself checked by JL and hit okay so I'm going to be doing that for all the other sheets I'm going to fast forward that part as well all right so this is the last one sheet number 10 and then I'm going to hit okay and so all of our 10 sheets are ready now bear in mind if you need it add some more sheets you can always go back and rename our renumber the sheets so that's not a problem just go back through the same process you could change the number at the top as well and the name of the sheet so you know you have no problem where that is concerned so on this first sheet which we are currently in the perspective view sheet I'm going to see if I can pull this over for get it to the back all right good so this is the first sheet and we're on that sheet and on this sheet we are going to be pulling in a 3D view that I have created using a camera and this is something I'm going to have to show you guys how to do in another video but it's pretty simple if you mess around you probably figure it out so what you do when you have a view is to simply drag that view to the page and that is how simple it is guys when you have your views it's a matter of just dragging and dropping though I noticed that my my side plan is gone I'm going to see if I can recover it properties it should be showing in there I'm not sure why it's not let's see if that helps there we go all right so that's what our 3D view looks like and I think I am going to yeah I'm not going to put anything else on this sheet I was thinking of putting the table of content on this sheet but let's see what this looks like I'm going to change the quality to maximum I'm going to apply it preview this is what it looks like it looks a little choppy at this time but when you actually print it out it's going to come out much better than that so don't worry about that all right so our first sheet has been created our well our view has been added let's open up our side plan and no all we need to do is to drag and drop our side plan view that we would have created earlier in this episode so let's drag him and drop him so I'm going to drop him right in the corner gone here and if you notice the title is kind of cut off so let me kind of drag this down a little bit and if you notice it even adds the number in there which is nice so I'm going to kind of shift this down because I do have some additional information to add to this sheet I want to add the location map which we have spoken about earlier I'm going to drop it maybe like right here and if you notice it continues on that numbering so that's perfect and then I'm going to grab my project notes and I'm going to drop it maybe like maybe like right here and I'm also going to drag and drop the concrete notes somewhere like probably like here all right and finally I need to have the table of content drop on here as well and this is where it becomes easy guys you don't have to sit down on type of a table of content all you gotta do is right click on your sheet set and you're going to say insert sheet list table and it brings up this sheet list table thing here where you could actually select if you had a table style created from you know the beginning of the project you could use your table style I didn't create one so I'm going to just work with the default style and you could go through the settings and mess around also over here is where you would go through and select the sheets that you actually want to appear in the list okay and of course I want all of my sheets so I'm just hit okay once I do that is just a matter of placing it where I want so I'm going to drop it right there and just like that I have all of my sheets done and the good thing about it is if I add another sheet in our change in name or change the number anything of that nature it would update here all you got to do is to just click on the heading here at the top right click and you would go down and say sheet list table and update all right now I want to add a text up here so I'm going to just go ahead and insert our go home text about half inches big all right so here I'm going to have proposed dwelling for a lot number eight 334 had the new Manchester all right so that's the information I want at the top of my sheet of course it would vary based on what you would usually put on years so this is what I'm going to have at the top here big and bold and outstanding all right and so guess what guys my first page is finished when I kind of just pull this up a little bit so let's take a little preview to see what that would actually look like and this is what we have everything is perfect including our sheet index and everything looks nice so let's move right along because there's quite a bit of pages to go all right so let's go ahead and open up for a third drawing and on this one I'm going to be dropping the floor plan so let's go up to floor plan and I'm going to drop that one and here just like that and I'm going to drop the schedules so the first schedule I'm going to drop would be a door schedule I want the door schedule on the top because it's very long then I'm going to put the window schedule and the room schedule now the room schedule is one that I created after the fact while I was preparing for this video I thought it would be a good addition to the page so I did record the behind the scenes and added it to my page on page so if that's something you're interested in definitely check that out there's quite a lot to be learned from how to do schedules I'm going to be doing a video in the future anyhow so stick around for that I'm just trying to meet in these up so it looks you know okay on the page all right so that's all we're going to be having on this sheet all right let's take a quick preview of that make sure everything is looking okay all right nice if you notice these are not filled in but don't worry they are going to be automatically filled in as we place these views on sheets all right so let's go ahead and hit the save button for that let's go to our fourth page and this is where we're going to be adding our front elevation so let's go down to front elevations drag him in try to drop it in the center there and also I think it was a right elevation that we've done here and I'm a drop him maybe like about there all right I've been noticed again it's numbering the views as we go along all right and I just don't need to do anything else that's really what all I need to do now my top up here is getting a little bit crowded so I'm going to close this one and keep going let's open up my fifth sheet which would now have my back elevation and my left elevation bring it down a little bit look in beautiful instead of all right so let's do the sixth page and we're going to go ahead and open up our section views section A right there and section B right there now some of my text are being caught off so let me kind of widen the view a little bit more all right perfect let's get the top up all right and that's it for my section and views let me take a quick view and see if everything looks good perfect and so if I save this and I X this off and I refresh this page it's not working alright let me X it off yes save it and reopen it that would be the floor plan now those sheet numbers would be updated with the current sheet and even if you drag those views to a new sheet it would also be updated so that's how AutoCAD works all right so I'm going to X this off save it X this off all right let's keep the first one all right let's move down to our electrical plan and we're going to drag and drop our electrical and drainage layout plan right here actually I'm going to place this byte self on this page along with the electrical and plumbing notes these are the only two things I'm going to be placing on this sheet so let me see how that looks preview looking wonderful all right and then go down to our next sheet electrical and the drainage legend and notes so if you go back to the views here you remember when we had created some details we have like for instance the grease trap basin some of drag this on have a little piece cutting off there let me see if I can fix that all right I also have the manhole detail so drag and drop and I also have trap gully basin detail as well that looks good all right so we do have a drainage legend bring that in place it here because I think the electrical legend is very long right so this one is very long if I had a larger sheet it would be perfectly fine but being let it is so long what I will have to do is to break it into three parts so I'm going to copy three times or two more times and then I'm going to just break it into parts all right so I'm going to kind of arrange them before I bring them on the sheet and then I'm going to bring them all over to the sheet and drop it maybe like right here I could actually bring these down a notch all right and then we're going to take a look at that page see what that looks like and looking pretty good to me now if you notice these are out of whack that's because I was messing around with them earlier but don't worry we're going to fix them it's pretty easy to fix so we're going to take a look at that in a moment all right we're going to hit save and then let's get out of that page and let's go down to our next page which would be foundation and we're going to go back to our views foundation plan drag or foundation in I'm going to place it over to the side here because I think we have quite a few details to be added to this sheet so this will be our first view then we're going to go down to details and drag in our foundation footing detail we're going to drop in maybe like about here all right looks like it fits in there pretty good I could move this over a notch all right looking good and then I do have like the L stiffener and the stiffener and that stiffener so let's bring these in L stiffener where the T stiffener all right as well as the I stiffener these are columns and then we also have the square column so I'm going to bring this in as well I'm going to drop it I don't know I'll find some space here to drop it that looks pretty good to me all right so if you notice we have them numbered in order so that's nice that's how we want them to be and then so this page is pretty much finished let me take a look at it in preview it's good to check your pages guys because I want to make sure you're seeing everything nothing is being caught off now if you notice again these numbers are not being updated as yet and don't worry we're going to get that done hit save and then we have one last sheet left and that would be our roof plan so let's go back to our views here and we're going to go to our roof framing plan we're going to drag him in place it right there and then we do have two details to be added in that would be the let's go down to details now would be the Eve detail all right so let's bring that in nice and then our ridge details guys it couldn't get any easer than this couldn't really really could preview per fat so how do we update these views so we have a couple of them we have the roof plan we have the foundation plan and I think we have another one and or remember which one it was can you remind me guys let me see if you're following all right so how do we edit these we will have to go back to the view itself all right so in this case we're going to go back to the foundation plan all right and what you will have to do here is to drag this call out onto the view that it corresponds with so far instance this would be what the ice tiffener so what we're going to do is to drag this here just like that over to the ice tiffener like that and it will update the numbering and everything in there likewise we're going to do this one again t-stiffener so I'm going to drag this down to the t and it would update with the corresponding view number and sheet number I'm going to do the L drag this under the L and it's done I'm going to drag this onto the square column all right and then we're going to hit save and exit and if we should go back to the foundation plan you will see it ask it to reload that drawing and if you hit reload it now updates within this drawing so the t would be number four on this page and if you look at number four number four the t on page s 0 1 so the next one would have been our roof plan so let's open up our roof plan and we're going to do the same thing this one would be our ridge detail so I'm going to drag this over to the ridge where is it ridge good and then this one would be Eve and that's the only tool we have in here I don't think we have anymore let's refresh this page and there we go looking perfectly I'm going to exit this off I'm going to exit this off yes go back to my sheets and just look over I think the side plan looks good the floor plan and schedule looked good elevation let's look at the sectional views because I thought we had some unheard and needed to be updated as well these ones are automatic because these were already mapped when we did them all right so perfect and everything seemed to be fine now I think it's time to go ahead and print so once you have all your sheets ready you know you know that everything is good you can go ahead and print sometimes it's good to print them out and review it now it's very very easy to print guys this is the good thing about the sheet set manager all you have to do is to right click on your sheet set go go to publish and go to whichever format you would like of course I'm going to be choosing PDF all right and all I have to do is basically just select the area in which I want are the folder in which I want to save this file so of course that would be on my deck stuff I did have one there already but I'm going to replace that file so I'm going to hit select and I'm going to say yes and once that is done it's going to go through all pages one by one and let's wait on it here all right so that is it let's go to our deck stop and open that drawing up here it is and this is what it looks like all right so I'm going to put it in full screen mode so you can see what it looks like if you notice this comes out a lot cleaner than it looked in the in AutoCAD we go to our second page this is what it looks like everything is how it's is supposed to be nicely done our location map is looking good our floor plan with our schedules are looking wonderful nice and then we go to our elevation views everything is intact all right our section of views are looking good all of our collotes are reading properly all right our drainage and electrical plan is perfect our details oh you see this is why we have to review our drawings because these were not done all right so good let's go back over all right so we need to open up our detailed views so details yes all right so these will need to be updated so I need to drag these onto the respective views so I'm going to drag this onto the brief strap basin drag this also onto the brief strap basin this one is the trap golly basin so I'm going to drag this onto trap golly basin like what is here and then this one is the manhole so let me drag this onto manhole drag this onto the manhole perfect and then I'm going to hit save closed and of course I'm going to take a look at that sheet I think it was this sheet here there we have it those are being updated perfectly so let's go ahead and reprint publish new diff my desktop select yes all right minimize that reopen and we are all good to go so I'll be posting this PDF in the description below so definitely go ahead and download if you want this would be a good reference for you to use and follow through
