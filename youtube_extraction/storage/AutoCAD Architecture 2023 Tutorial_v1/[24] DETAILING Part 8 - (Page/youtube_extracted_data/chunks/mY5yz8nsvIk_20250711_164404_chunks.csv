Hello everyone, welcome to the 24th and final episode on the one-bedroom house series
that we have been doing on the channel. In today's video I'll be showing you how to get your
sheets all set up in AutoCAD and how to print them in PDF format. So you might hear terminologies like
sheet template, field text, sheet set, subsets or sheet properties, stuff like that but don't worry,
I'm sure by the end of this episode you'll understand what all of that means.
Now this video is going to be a long one so buckle up. What I'll do is to break this video in the
parts so that you can skip to the part that you want to watch. So if that's something you want to
do check the description below for the timestamps. You all said, I got you. I'll also be dropping the
playlist for all the other episodes just in case you missed one or two aren't. You haven't seen it at
all. Check the description."
1,"sodes just in case you missed one or two aren't. You haven't seen it at
all. Check the description. Yes, so I did enjoy making these videos and I hope that you enjoyed watching
them as well and if you did comment below which ones were your favorite and if you're first I'm
on a channel or if you haven't subscribed as yet, I'll sub this solid. All right, so let me stop talking
and jump right into AutoCAD and show you how to do this thing. All right everybody, so here we are
back in AutoCAD architecture and let's jump right into it. So as you already know we're going to be
creating all of our sheets today but before I get into that I want to show you three additional
views that I have created ahead of time for this video today. So I did do a location map as you can see
right here. I also did some additional site information. You know just type of a little thing here and I
also did some concrete notes here. Typical stuff, you know, just to make it into something we can
place on the sheet."
2,"rete notes here. Typical stuff, you know, just to make it into something we can
place on the sheet. All right, now the location map actually I went on Google and I just find a spot
and just take a snippet of it and as you can see I drew a box on the area and also kind of put a little
text there to kind of identify the property. Also when you're doing a location map you want to make sure
you have other, you know, table buildings or properties around so that persons who would like to
locate the property can use those buildings as a landmark or as a references. So bear that in mind
when you're going on Google to snip a photo or a snippet of that on here. Now this location map is not
to scale so I'm going to actually change this from one eight to NTS because it's not done to
scales so I don't want to have a scale there. Now if you notice this text up here is a little bit
different from the others and that's because this is what we call a field text meaning this information
is being pulled from somewhere else. All right and I'm going to show you exactly where it is being
pulled from."
3,"led from somewhere else. All right and I'm going to show you exactly where it is being
pulled from. If we go back to our project Navigator where we see the project let me come out of that
project tab here and we go to the little pencil. You remember when we started this project now we did
types of information in this box here to describe the project or what we say project description.
And so this is exactly what is being seen out here and so by using field text we can pull various
information from out of the project Navigator and other areas as well into our details or notes
and also our title block which is going to be very important as we get further into this video.
All right so how do you add fields when you create a text box like this one here? All you have to
do in fact let me create a brand new one so let's just do our random one out here.
One two are inside of the text box you are able to add a field in and so once you click on that
you just need to locate the one that you want."
4,"able to add a field in and so once you click on that
you just need to locate the one that you want. So that particular one would fall on AEC projects
and it would be the project description and then of course you can choose whether or not you
want it to be uppercase or lowercase whatever. I'm not going to select any I'm going to just hit
okay and there it is it included it in that text box. All right now that is important because
when we go back into this settings here and we go down a little bit further where it says
detail information when I click on this you will notice that I have a lot of other information in
here and we're going to need to be able to pull these out into our title block. So this is something
you can set up at the beginning of your project as well as at the end or wherever in the middle
but wherever you choose to do it you need to have it in so that you can pull these out in your
title block."
5,"ever you choose to do it you need to have it in so that you can pull these out in your
title block. So as you can see I have the address for the project the volume and volume number.
This is a number that is unique to every property on the island so if we need to locate a property
in the database they would just type that number in likewise with the coordinates."
6,"ocate a property
in the database they would just type that number in likewise with the coordinates. Every property
has a coordinate client information you can go ahead and add in stuff like that and it's very simple
all you have to do is to click on the plus button here to add a line and you just type what you need
and if you need to delete that line which I'm actually going to do here you just click on the X
and as you can see I actually added an extra folder here for architectural firm and that
can be done using the folder icon here and so as you can see I added some additional information
within this folder you know so I added the firm's name address telephone number and email and also
for some fun we added the YouTube and Instagram and Twitter as well as some architect notes.
Guys go ahead and add all the information that you're going to need in this box here so that we can
use them later when we need them. Alright so I'm going to access off now and we're going to stay
in this property setting here we're going to scroll down to where we see sheet template."
7,"ng to stay
in this property setting here we're going to scroll down to where we see sheet template. Now if
you remember when we had created this project back in episode I think it was episode two
we did select this template here as our sheet template okay and we also selected this size as the
size that we're going to be using for this project of course if you're doing a larger project you
would want to select a larger page."
