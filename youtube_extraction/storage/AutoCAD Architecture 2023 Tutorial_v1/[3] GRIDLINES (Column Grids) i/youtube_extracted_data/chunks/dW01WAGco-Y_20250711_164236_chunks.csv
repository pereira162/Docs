hi everyone thank you for joining me on
episode number three for one bedroom
series in the previous video we learned
how to set up our project in ArchiCAD
using the project browser and project
navigator alright so if you missed that
episode you need to watch it click the
link up there or click the link down
there because it's important that you
understand how to set up your project
before we move into the more exciting
stuff you're I'm saying yeah so in the
previous video we learned how to set up
our projects using the project browser
which is it's little about right here
and also the project navigator alright
because if you look over here this is
what we did we went through we set our
project settings we did our levels and
we also did our divisions alright so you
can't afford to miss that alright so
today is gonna be a little bit more
interesting because now we're going to
move to our constructs and this is where
we're gonna start to do actual drawing
all right now as"
1,"to
move to our constructs and this is where
we're gonna start to do actual drawing
all right now as you can see I have two
of the constructs open up here we have
the foundation and we also have the
ground floor which you can actually see
them over here alright so we would draw
our ground floor in this drawing and we
will draw our foundation in this drawing
but before we do any of these drawings
what we want to draw first is our grid
all right so today's video is about
gridlines how do we draw or unset up our
grid lines now for those of you who
don't know what grid lines are grid
lines are also commonly referred as
column grids okay now most times column
grids are used on large buildings where
there's a lot of columns throughout the
building so take for instance this
building right all right
this building has quite a few columns
throughout it all right now can you
identify any of the columns in this
building of course you can all right you
can see one here and there but what if I
were t"
2,"mns in this
building of course you can all right you
can see one here and there but what if I
were to add some column grids to it like
that now you're able to identify each
column by name so for instance if I say
to you where is column f1 you'll be able
to locate column f1 if I say where is
column a tube we'll be able to locate
column a2 and so now you can start to
appreciate significance of column grids
throughout a building all right
it helps to layout your columns and it
also help you to locate columns all
right now there are many more advantages
of column grids but we're gonna stick to
those two for today all right
so what would a column grid look like
for a one bedroom house like the one
that we're about to do now it would look
something like this
all right of course a tiny bedroom house
like this doesn't need column grids but
this way you will be able to apply these
principles to your larger projects okay
guys so what we're gonna do is to open
up our grid line drawing so what we'"
3,"our larger projects okay
guys so what we're gonna do is to open
up our grid line drawing so what we're
going to do so just open it like that
and it is in this project or this
drawing that we're gonna do
gridlines of course we could go ahead
and start to just draw our grid lines
starting at the zero zero point here but
I want to start mine somewhere up here
so our grid line will take up this space
here so what I'm gonna do is to draw a
line from 0 0 up at a 45 degree angle so
let's click on our line tool and I'm
gonna type it says here specify your
first point I want my first point to be
0 0 now you can see that man I'm
starting at 0 0 and then I'm gonna draw
a line at 45 degrees so I'm gonna put
the less than sign 45 enter now my line
is running on the 45-degree angle
alright so I can't draw another a line
at any other angle because I set it at a
45 degree and then I'm gonna type how
far away do I want it to go so I'm gonna
put 25 feet enter alright so that is
where we're gonna start t"
4,"away do I want it to go so I'm gonna
put 25 feet enter alright so that is
where we're gonna start to draw our grid
lines so our grid lines should take up
this space right there let me minimize
that so we can see a little bit clearer
alright so let's go ahead and draw our
first grid line now we need 4 vertical
lines and two horizontal lines
so our first vertical line is going to
be drawn upwards now if you notice I
don't have my 90 degrees turned on this
is important because grid lines must be
perfectly straight so you want to turn
this on that way your your your lines
will be perfectly straight all right
line up 90 degrees so let's go ahead and
we're going to draw our first grid line
which
be 16 feet enta now this is what 16 feet
looks like looks let's check it perfect
16 foot and then our next line vertical
line is 9 feet 6 inches away from this
one
so what we're going to use is the offset
tool offset how far you want it off of
that would be 9 feet 6 inches enter and
then we're gonna"
5,"fset
tool offset how far you want it off of
that would be 9 feet 6 inches enter and
then we're gonna click on the side that
you want it on so of course we don't
want it on the side we want it on this
side so we're gonna click over there
then though the other line would be 5
foot 6 inches away from this one so
we're going to offset again offset type
in your distance which would be 5 feet 6
inches and then we're gonna just do like
that click over there and then of course
our fourth grid would be offset again 12
foot are feet 6 inches oh dear we have
it so now we have all 4 vertical lines
no our horizontal lines actually they
are just two and there they would be
exactly at the top and at the bottom of
these lines now of course if you had
some in the middle we would go ahead and
use the offset tool to offset those but
being that we only have two here we just
need to complete the box there all right
of course we're gonna go ahead and
delete this because we don't need that
again this is what"
6,"l right
of course we're gonna go ahead and
delete this because we don't need that
again this is what we need so what we're
gonna do next is to extend each line
outwards out of the box about 12 inches
all right now there are many ways you
can do this but I'm gonna just use a
very simple way that everybody can
understand so what we're going to do is
just click on the box here
again ensure that your artha is turned
on all right click on this box drag it
out and type 12 inches enter okay so
we're going to do that for all of these
lines drag it out twelve launches all
right so I'm gonna just move a little
quick quickly here so we can speed
through this part I'm gonna do all of
them like that
but those of you who know easier way to
do it please feel free to go ahead and
use it easier method there we go so now
we have something that is looking pretty
close to what we need all we need now is
our bubble all right
now that is the part that AutoCAD will
actually generate for us all right so
what"
7,"bubble all right
now that is the part that AutoCAD will
actually generate for us all right so
what we're gonna do is to open up what
is called our tool palette or design
tool palette now if you're not seeing
this guy right here you can actually
find it up here so click on this thing
and click on this little guy right here
there you'll find this tool palette all
right now when you open it up you'll
have a lot of stuff you have design wall
doors windows everything is right here
what we want to go to design and under
design you will find column grid okay so
of course if we click on it like that
AutoCAD is giving us a grid but we don't
want that great because we already have
our layout here so what we're gonna do
is to right click and say apply to line
work good
so because we had already create some
lines here we want AutoCAD to use our
lines so we're gonna highlight them all
right and it says here select your line
work we already selected it or selected
them now we're gonna hit enter
it"
8,"ays here select your line
work we already selected it or selected
them now we're gonna hit enter
it says here enter your how far away
from these lines do you want your
bubbles 4 feet that's the standard enter
do you want to erase these line work the
answer is yes so click on yes and what
it does here is to erase your line work
and replace them with
the proper gridlines all right so of
course this is what AutoCAD generates
for us all right so we have a wonderful
grid line set up here now if you'll
notice the bubbles are a little bit too
big and that's because of the scale that
we are using the correct scale would be
one in 50 which which is equivalent to
quarter inch to one foot so they're
gonna click on that and now our bubbles
are now at the correct size all right
now it's important that you adjust that
because when you're gonna print your
drawing you're going to be printing it
on that scale so you need to ensure that
your bubbles are at the correct scale
and size all right guys so we"
9,"scale so you need to ensure that
your bubbles are at the correct scale
and size all right guys so we're gonna
move on from here what you can do from
this point is to just check to ensure
that your grid lines are where there
should be so that's nine foot six this
one is five foot six in fact let's let's
add these dimensions
now for those of you who do know where
to find the dimension is right here so
it could click on it click on linear and
this one would be what 16-foot right
perfect
alright now I'm gonna put these on a
separate layer dimensions so let's do
that
oh if you don't know how layers work I
have a video on this so I'm gonna link
it up there go and watch the video as
well alright so we're gonna create a
layer for this and call it the dimension
layer and when I give it another color
switch this to its whatever yellow line
weight so I'm going to select all of
these select similar and I'm gonna move
them to the dimension layer all right so
now we verify that our dimensions are
pe"
10,"and I'm gonna move
them to the dimension layer all right so
now we verify that our dimensions are
perfect where they're at now we need to
put in some labels into these bubbles
alright so what we're gonna do is to
click on the grid line itself and say
edit label once we say edit label it
says here pick the first custom column
grid line so I wanna do we're gonna do
these ones first and we're gonna label
these numerically okay so we're gonna
start at 1 2 3 4 so what you want to do
is to pick them in the order in which
you want the numbers to to follow so
let's say that would be 1 this would be
2 this would be 3 and this would be 4
and then what you're gonna do is to hit
enter and then it asked you know what do
you what do you want a pallet to be this
is where you say ok you want it to be
numerical so I wanted to start at number
one enter and now you can see AutoCAD
populates your bubbles with the numbers
that you need one two three four and it
would have done the same at the bottom
field"
11,"th the numbers
that you need one two three four and it
would have done the same at the bottom
field so I'm gonna do the same thing at
the side this time we're gonna use
alphabet alright so click on the grid
edit label and we're going to select
this to be a and then this would be B
enter now we're gonna enter the first
letter in our sequence which would be a
now make sure you use capital e because
if you use common a it's gonna populate
the entire thing with common letters all
right so a B now guess what we're done
our grid line is done there's nothing
else left to do here more than to save
so we're gonna go ahead and we're gonna
hit save and that would be our grid line
no let's say if you wanted to add more
grid lines of course you just click on
the grid and say add a grid line and
then of course you click on that line
that you drew and follow through the
commands down here but for this project
this is where we're going to stop it
that's all we need
we're gonna hit the same button agai"
12,"project
this is where we're going to stop it
that's all we need
we're gonna hit the same button again
just to be sure
so what we're gonna do in our next video
is to move to our ground floor which is
where we're gonna now draw our ground
floor here no this is the beautiful
thing we can actually bring in our grid
lines into this project all we would
need to do is to right-click on the grid
and say xref overlay
alright xref means external reference so
what this is doing is to pull the the
excel file from out
side into your current drunk so we're
pulling the gridlines into this drawing
so now we're in or groan for what or
glory or gridlines are now showing up
within our ground floor now if you
notice it comes in as a block all right
so we can edit the grid line from here
we would have to go back to our grid
lines to edit our grid line all right
now we know that grid line is good so
we're not gonna change anything over
there so this is where we're at with our
ground floor all right so we're"
13,"gonna change anything over
there so this is where we're at with our
ground floor all right so we're gonna
stop it right here in the next video
we're gonna be drawing our walls gonna
put in some doors and windows now we're
gonna kick it off real good alright guys
so pick up on yourself I'm gonna for
watching this episode again trust me for
the like the video just hit the like
button and let me know owner enjoy the
team
