want is site to look like we're gonna do some landscape word plant some trees some grass and a couple look at things you know to make it look like somewhere we would actually want to live [Music] okay so drawing your side plant can be another fun activity so on a side plan you get the opportunity to make the landscape exactly how you want it to look so we get to add a various trees shrubs edging gardens driveway pavements pools etc etc but for today's demonstration I'm gonna make it very simple we're gonna just do the basic stuff and I might just add one or two little thing here and there but

this drawing in order to know where the building is located on the site they want to know if you are abiding by setbacks and zoning regulations they want to see you how the drainage is laid hope they wanna see what the landscape looks like all of that they want to see also the site plan is being used by the contractor because when the contractor is ready to lay out the building he will need to know where to start laying on the billion euros that the site plan is also used by landscapers the guys who are gonna come in and plant the trees they need to know where to plant which tree we're to put the pavement and our that kind of stuff Meza and also later on the home owner might want to do additions to the building or to sell the property and this side plan would be required to do any of these tasks all right now with all of that said let's get over into AutoCAD and see what we can do over there alright guys so here we are back in the drawing so if you remember when we set up the project from day one we had created a property boundary construct and it would have been in this drawing that we would have created our property boundary all right so let's let me open this drawing up and as you can see here I already have a layout of the property that we're going to be placing the building on I recently did a video on how to do this so if you don't know how to do it oh and watch that video so the diagram would be found on the surveys report and we would use the the bearings and the distance is provided by the surveyor to get this diagram because we need to make sure that it is as accurate as possible all right no the first part of this video that I'm gonna be doing should have been done from even before we started to do the ground floor and the foundation alright this is something that I I overlooked in the beginning of this project so what I'm gonna be doing is to split this video into so what I'm gonna do first is to show you what we should have done from the beginning of the project and then in Part 2 or the second half of this video I'm gonna be showing what we would do after which would be at this point in the in the project alright alright so after we have the the drawing the diagram looking like this what we would do is - first thing I would say set the scale so make sure that your scale is 1/8 and this is equivalent to 1 in 100 if you're using millimeters as your units this is like that the regular scale that we use because the building is really small if you had a very large building then we would probably go for one in 16 which would be the same as 1 in 200 and so on and so forth all right so we're gonna work with one it perfect and the second thing we're gonna do is to create some layers alright remember that we're going to be placing trees pavement and so on so I want to create a layer for all of these elements alright so I have my layers palette right here if you don't know where to find it it is right here and this little guy right here layer properties and I actually have a video on how to create layers so if you don't know how to create layers check that video out but for this video I'm gonna just go right ahead and create some layers I'm gonna put a s before all of them just to say this is a layer that is on a site plan so the S represents site all right put a - and the first one I'm gonna create is the property line I'm gonna change the color to blue maybe that you can choose the color you want we usually use Phantom for the line type and the line Oita I'm gonna just set it at probably point 4 then I'll create a new one call this one setback and I'm gonna make this one red and I'm gonna change it from phantom to - and I'm gonna make the line wait a little bit promise 13 I think all the others are gonna be 0.13 so create another one call this one pavement enter I'm going to give this a gray color and I'm gonna make this continuous and I'm gonna leave it on the 13 create another one call this one vegetation and of course the vegetation would be some sorta green color continuous 13 perfect and then I'm gonna create one last one I'm gonna call this one the road and of course you can choose whichever color you would like and the line width is just about what I have here you can work with the language but that's for the hour for the line type and the color I would say try to adopt these ones until you're able to come up with your own style and technique alright so so far we can see now that we have all of these layers inside of our drop-down here so the first thing we're going to do is to draw the road so let's go to the road layer and of course we want to represent as close as possible the width of the road and if there's a sidewalk and that kind of thing so for this for this diagram I'm gonna put a sidewalk of five feet all right and the road width would be 18 feet and these would depend on the area alright so if it is a city area you know you would have a wider street and maybe a wider sidewalk and if it's a more residential rural here you'd have a narrower street and a narrower sidewalk and you might have sidewalks on both side or on one side whatever the case may be alright so make sure you go on the side and you try to get an accurate measurement and so what I'm gonna do now is to just offset well draw a line first here now let's turn the artha more on like that well this kind of stretch it out a little bit further off of the back now what I'm gonna do is to offset the sidewalk from this line so I'm gonna make it five feet away from that then I'm gonna offset another 18 feet which would be the width off the road so let's do a sit again 18 feet enter and then that would be the width of the road of course we could add another sidewalk here but I don't care about this side of the road I want to care about this side right now so I'm gonna leave it right there what I'm gonna do is to get the center line in the middle of the road though because that's gonna be an important line that we will need later on in this video all right so we're gonna do another offset and the middle of that road would actually be 9 feet all right so there we have our 9 feet and I'm gonna actually change the line type here to dashed so that it looks like our road would look of course the dashed line would mean you can overtake here which we don't know really all right so at this point we can see that we have the road what I'm gonna do here now is to change this property box to move it over to the current layer which will be the property line there and then we're I'm gonna explode it so I can work on each line individually what I'm gonna do also is to trim out this orange piece off the road so I can see the property boundary underneath so I go to the trim tool shrim I think this is it shrimp now I'm gonna select this and this enter and then we want to trim this guy out so just like that we can now see the property boundary underneath all right so from here what we're gonna do is to put our setbacks boundary in all right so for this drawing of a dis property the setbacks are 5 feet from the sides both sides 15 feet from the back and 20 feet from the center of the road on the front all right now these information again you would get from your local authorities these are very critical information and I will explain some more later on in this video so what I'm gonna do is to do some more offsets again notice we using the offset to very regularly here so we're gonna offset 15 feet on the back okay then it's gonna be another offset which would be five feet on the sides all right just like that and then it should be twenty feet from the center of the road so let's do another offset twenty feet from the center line that is why we needed the centerline all right so in Jamaica they use the centerline at the front of the building or the front of the property I'm not sure if that's how they do it in other countries but the reason for this is so that if in the future the government decides to widen the street everyone on this particular street would have the the amount of space necessary for that future development all right so this is very important as we can see here is that we have a space within the property all right I'm gonna actually highlight this space using the setback layer that we created earlier so I'm gonna use a setback layer and I'm gonna go to polyline and draw just an outline around this space like so enter and then I'm gonna actually delete or erase these guys now cuz I don't need them anymore alright enter so here we have the red box telling us that we can only build within these boundaries even though you have your whole property you buy your land but guess what you're only allowed to build within the sandbox and this is very important and there are many reasons all right for this particular property let's say you have a river running behind it if you watch the video on how to draw this you would have seen that there's a river running behind here and so they want to ensure that you build far away enough because if the river should let's say take away a piece of the land then your house would be safe alright we explain the front already and also on the sides they want to make sure that you have adequate space away from the boundary so that your neighbor you're building the sapphic your neighbor and vice versa so it's different in other areas those in some areas you're allowed to build as close to the to the boundary especially if it is a condensed area like cities and so on so it all varies you just need to find out what the setbacks are in whatever are whichever area you're gonna be doing the building for alright so we need to ensure that whatever we're gonna design can fit within this space here and we're talking about the main building itself so if you have another like a accessory building that's different that can be at least much closer or anywhere else on the property for instance if you have an attached garage or let's say a dog house our pig pen whatever the case may be those other things can be anywhere else but when it comes to the main building itself it has to be placed within six bucks all right so this is where part 1 of this video would end this is what you would do before you start to draw anything alright so let's move over into the second half of this video all right so now that we have everything here and we have the set back and what I'm gonna do is to place the building inside of the setback area all right but first let me connect these back together so I'm gonna use the join command and let's join these guys back together so I can get like a single object like that good alright so we're going to go over to our project navigator and with an xref the ground floor into this drawing alright so over here we can see that we have the ground floor and what I'm gonna do is - I don't want to move this drawing because this is an X reference file try not to move this all right what I'm gonna do is to move all of this over to the building so I'm gonna say all right use a move tool and I'm gonna move it from this edge right here all the way over to to the edge of this building right there I notice that there is a slider something is off right there I think this should go there right like that all right so I'm gonna move this over and I'm gonna drag it from this corner all the way over let me turn off my Arthur model so that it lines up with the edge of this building so just like that I know that my walls are within the Sigma here alright if the roof hang over a little bit that's fine don't worry about the roof what you should worry about are the walls you want to make sure that your walls are within the set back here if you have a pavement going over that's fine but the main building itself has to be within set back here now let's take a closer look and to make sure that everything is within the set but now if i zoom in here you can see that we have a breach right in this corner here and that's because this side of the property is actually running at a slight angle so as it goes up we can see that it gets closer and closer so I don't think this amount of breach would put in much of a trouble all right so what I'm gonna do is to move the property over some more so you want to make sure that you don't move the building so make sure you're on high like that if that's a word so I'm gonna move understand I'm gonna move it using the our thumb order as well so I'm gonna move it over a little bit like so so that this side is no within setbacks and now also if you notice this part of the wall is also within it by the way guys you are allowed to use the entire space alright so if you want to make the building as big as the space itself it's up to you but of course I want to have a driveway here and plant a couple trees and so on and so forth so we're gonna leave it right there we know that we're in the safe zone and from here we are going to hide this layer because now I'm doing with the setbacks so numbers hide it escape let me make this 0 layer active I'm gonna hide this layer I think this is also on the setback layer which is not what I want I want to put this under zero later so let's get that out of the way alright so now that we have everything let's look at it in 3d and see what we have alright so so far you can see that we have something that looks not too shabby alright so now what I'm gonna do is to add the driveway and and let's see where we get from there so we're going to shift over to pavement layer and we're gonna do some drawing so I'm gonna draw from the edge here this is where I want my driveway to stop I mean you can make it your own 11 feet wide maybe could go a little wider pull this all the way down to the side of the road like that and then I'm gonna give another line you wanna draw a nice front step out pavement here maybe six feet out and come across like this and then I'm gonna just line that up with that column and bring it down to the curb here alright so this is gonna be the driveway so I'll Drive up park here step out go inside do what I gotta do and so on alright and I have a lassika step on here here what we're gonna do is to kind of give it a little curve so let's use the filete tool and let's say we want the radius to be twelve inches and we're gonna do multiple because we're gonna have multiple of these so let's give these edges some fill it just you know make it look somewhat give it a lick of flair alright we're gonna do the same thing here I'm gonna use a three feet radius for this portion three feet and I don't know the standard if you know the standard drop it down below what the standard curve should be what I'm gonna use three feet nothing the car our vicar can make that turn if you notice it took away the line on this side so I'm gonna have to draw another and do the same thing again and then of course I'm gonna have to close this back right here this line and this line should be on the road there all right so we have the road we have the pavement coming in park here and we have an icicle front step out here what I'm gonna do is to give this curb a thickness and I'm gonna give it four inches I think that's the typical with off a curb so let's do the offset come on and we're gonna say four inches now I think I did four feet there let's go again four and just give this a lesson of thickness to now just to make it look something like you know like a curb or like that edge you don't have to do this again so go on Google look on there are many ways to make a site plan look look nice alright so I'm going to leave it there and then what I'm gonna also do is to draw a box around this using the Box tool of course if you had an irregular shape building you would want to use the polyline tool but since this is a rectangular I'm gonna just use a rectangle tool and the reason I'm doing this is because I can no detach the holes are unloaded rather and I would have this air telling me where exactly the house is located alright at this point we can go ahead and place our trees or cars and so on what before I do that what I'm gonna do is to hatch these areas so we're understand the pavement so good so what I'm gonna do is to go to the hatch tool this is just to add some additional texture and patterns to your drawing to make it look you know good we don't have to do this so let's go down and click on the drop down here and from here you can decide all right it's it gonna be a concrete pavement or is it gonna be some sort of brick layout it's up to you to decide so we have an icicle brick layout here or we could use this herringbone pattern style all right so let's try this one and I'm gonna make the pavement of that style so I'm gonna do here and here as you can see we have an icicle pavement right there and then we could do the grass as well so let's say we go down to the vegetation layer and we're gonna hatch again and this time we're gonna select something that says or something that look more like a grass like this and we're gonna say all right in now this is very very fine so we could actually make it a little bit bigger by changing the number here so let's say we made this ten all right go ahead and click that looks a little but so we're gonna work with that for now and so far we have something that looks like that and at this point we can go ahead and drop on some additional things like trees cars tables whatever you feel like you want to add of course I'm just gonna be doing the bare basic on here and also you would want to show your drainage layout and your septic tank your manholes all of those will be shown on this drawing that's what we do it in Jamaica in other places what they would do is to have a a different site plan for different services but for this we're gonna drop everything on here alright so what we're gonna do is to add some trees and of course if there were trees on the site already and you want to keep that tree then you would want to represent it on the side plan in the similar location all right but for this one we're gonna plan some brand new trees so let's go and find some trees all right now I'm gonna actually use some 3d trees we can use 2d I would actually recommend you use the 2d ones as well just so that it doesn't take up too much power off of your computer all right so we go into the content browser as usual and we go down to site and we're going to planting and from here you see all the different types of trees these ones that look 3d are actually in 3d so I'm gonna choose probably like this one I'm gonna say insert and I'm gonna drop probably one here all right you don't want to plant it on the edge cuz guess what its gonna go all the way over to people property and that kind of thing so you don't want to have your trees growing all over and people please love to do that kind of stuff alright so let us drop in some trees all over the place and I'm gonna try and drop another type maybe this one drop this one probably like right here on the front then let me see if I can find another type a drop one more tree in the back probably alright so these are all the trees I'm gonna plant and guess what we can take a look at it in 3d then this is what they would actually look like alright so I'm not gonna do anything else here to be actually what I'm gonna do is add a car so I'm gonna go back to site and then I'm gonna go to basic vehicle and you have to DV codes as well as 3d let's go over even have trucks for those of you who truck people so I'm gonna drop this car here or maybe the station wagon no compact car it's a one-man hose a one-man I drive so I'm going to insert I'm gonna just rotate this 90 degrees and I'm gonna drop it right in the spot here and just like that we have the car beautiful and now we have everything in 3d just like that alright and if I go to concept well you can have a better look at what this would look like all right and of course these these are the only things I'm gonna be doing in 3d you could actually model it the pavement and curb and try to get everything all 3d alright but I'm gonna leave it right here cuz this is enough for a drawing to be submitted to Parrish console what I'm gonna do is to reload it the house so I'm gonna go to my X references and reload so you can see what it actually looks like with the house I'm gonna see perspective so we can have an idea what everything would look like when it's all done alright so as I turn this around so you can see what we have in the next video I will be combining all the views so the foundation plus the ground floor and site I'm going to put everything together and then we can start to create our elevation views sectional views and plan views and all of those alright and of course I know that really and truly if you look the ground is on the same level as the finished floor level inside which is not supposed to be the case all right this should be six inches down which we are going to be addressing also in that video all right so don't worry about that for this I just want to see how it would look and looks just about what we want it and of course I expect you to customize yours the way you want alright so if you want a pool in the front of your house or if you want I don't know a water fountain whatever just make it your own do it how you want to do it alright now for the plan view this is what I should have shown you if you notice we're still seeing inside of the building if it is that you want to not see inside of the building or you just want to look at the roof itself of course what we would do is to raise the global cut plane from three feet six to anything above the roof so let's say 20 feet that would be above the roof alright now what I would do is to raise the cut plane from below to above the roof so now this is something more like what you would want to see on a side plan if you don't want to see inside the building we can always move it to conceptual or hidden so let's do that just like that we can see that we're having a bird's-eye view looking straight down on the building or on the property alright so later on when we start to add annotations and dimensions and so on and so to this drawing we will be adding the drainage layout and also a lot of other information will be to this drawing all right so that's the end of this video what was done today was just enough to get us through the gate and I really didn't want to make this video any longer so I hope that you learned something just explore all right and make your site plan look as unique and especially how you'd like and you know go on Google and loop on some other site plans and get some ideas and inspirations so I hope that you learned something if you have any questions you know the drill I really drop them in the comments and also don't forget to subscribe don't forget to hit the like one and yeah you have a good week [Music]",
