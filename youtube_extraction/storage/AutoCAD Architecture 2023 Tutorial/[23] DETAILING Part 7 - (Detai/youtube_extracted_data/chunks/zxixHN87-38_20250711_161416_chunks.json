Alright, so this little tab up here if you click on it,\nit has a number of things in there depending on if you're using the standard or metric,\nyou can go ahead and select the library that you want to use, where using the US library right\nand all of the material and components available here will be in standard measurements.\nAlright, so of course we can go and drill down into different types of components and we can choose\ndifferent sizes or types based on what we are looking for. We can even type in things that we may\nneed. Let's say we want hurricane anchors. So we have hurricane straps. If you want,\nlet's say you want something else, you can just search for it in here. Alright, but you don't have to\nalways come inside of here because we do have a tool palette that has some items inside of it. So if\nyou click on this little setting and you go down to detailing, you would find that we have a lot of\nthose same components located here for just quick access.",

You know, so there are times when you're going to have to literally draw your own\ndetail and that's perfectly fine. That's all. I do a lot of my details currently just the same.\nWhat I'm going to be using mainly what is in the library for this project. So I hope that you\nenjoy it and you'll learn something. And if you do hit the subscribe hit the like drop a comment\nask the questions and share the video. Alright, let's begin. So we're going to start with the\n2x4 that is located at the top of the window. So let's click on the wood and right away we get\nwood looking block there but that's not the right size. It says 2x4 but that's not the\ncot I want. I actually want a rough cot and I'm going to change the size to 2x4.",

No guys, it's important for you to know that\nthese blue lines will not be printed. This is just an outline or a shape out of the detail and\nOtica is saying to you, you need to fill in the areas that needs to be filled in. Alright, just\nlike these other detail that I did Otica provides the outline and you fill in the gaps.\nLikewise when I provided these details earlier. Some episodes ago we had just had the outline\nand then we would use these components to fill in where we can fill in. And of course,\nsome of these I had to use lines to draw like these are just regular lines I used to draw them\nand kind of just create some details. So it's a combination. Alright, so you work it all you can.\nThe next thing I'm going to place on here would be the lintel as well as the beam.\nI'm going to show you how I did it.",

So go to concrete and go to beams where I already on beams\nand I want it to be customizable and I'm going to make it six inches by one feet. That's good.\nI'm going to change turn off this shumper, shumper thing. No, so it becomes rectangular and then\ndo I want to see the reinforcement? No, because I want to make my own reinforcement. So I'm going to\nplace this right there and then while I'm in the command I'm going to just change the height to\neight inches because the lintel will be eight inches deep and then I'm going to flip it on the x-axis\nso that it comes at the top and then I can drop it right on top of there. Good. So now I have my\ntwo concrete areas there. Then I'm going to drop some blocks inside of here. So let's go to concrete\nto masonry and we're going to change from clay to CMU. And of course we're going to slip the\nsize block that we used for this project which would have been six by eight by 16. That's what it\nlooks like in a section of view.",

I'm going to draw our line upwards and if you notice as you draw your line up it builds\non top of each other more and more but we're going to just build it to what we need which would be\njust two rows of blocks and then need to center this in the middle here.

I'm just doing it based on what I use in Jamaica. All right so for this beam I'm going to\nbe using four inch rebar not four inch rather number four rebar and you need to know your rebar\nsizes so make sure you check that out and I'm going to instead of using single rebar like what you're\nseeing there I'm going to switch it to an assembly which would be rectangle column which actually\ngives me the tie along with you know some other rebars in there so I'm going to just change some\nnumbers in here to get their amount of rebar that I need.",

So essentially I'm using a number four rebar on the inside\nand the number three rebar on the outside to create the ties. All right and if we can actually draw\none of these and see what it looks like. It should look something like that so the tie it would be\na number three and one on the inside would be a number four. So let's go ahead and draw our\nsteel rebar inside there put one more in here. Looking good all right so that covers a multi-tube of\nsin. All right let's go.",
