  "full_text": "hi so this is episode 6 of our one bedroom series and it's now time to place our windows yes so if that is something you want to learn so the two types of window that we're going to be using on this building are glider windows and pivot window but there is one before so as you can see the bladder window looks like this it slides in the horizontal direction it is important to note though that this is different from double-hung window which slides in the vertical direction the other window is the pivot window which looks like this it has a pivot in the center of the window which can be horizontal or vertical as you can see right there all right that would allow the window to be swiveled in and out and of course there are many different variants of these windows so be sure to check the link in the description to read more about the different types further ado let's again alright so here we are back in the drawing alright so in the last video we did our openings and did our doors so on the bottom right of your screen you're gonna see a list of all the windows that we're gonna be putting in this building alright so we have a total of seven windows and if you look at the first four windows they are basically the same size the same style everything about them is the same they are just in different locations so one and two would be in the bedroom three and four would be in a living room and then five and six the in the kitchen and then seven would be in the bathroom alright so we're gonna go back to our plan view let's go back to top 2d wireframe so we go back to our tool palette and we go down to windows alright so I have a few windows here we could search for more windows by clicking on the more window tool or go to our home tools content browser Imperial or metric depending on which one you are using we're doing imperial and you would search for windows and doors and we go over to windows you can explore these other options like corner windows where we could have a 90-degree corner window and so on and so forth but we're not using corner in it for this drawing I'm gonna just use a regular windows so go ahead and explore and see the available windows that are there for this drawing I think we have the one that we need right in the inside of this palette we could actually make this a little bigger by going here view options and make the icon a little bigger so let me see alright so now you see that where is it glider all right it's like a sliding window so we're going to click on it and the first thing we're going to do is to set the size that we need and we know that this window should be now 4 by 4 window which is a standard sized window that we use a lot in Jamaica so 4 by 4 again we're going to set our measurement to be outside of the frame and we're gonna go down and we're going to make some adjustment down here for the location so the first thing is that we want it to be on this option which is the offset Center and we want it to be 0 and we also want a justification to be on Center as well all right remember when we did our doors we're doing the same thing here and we want the vertical alignment to be head the head is the top of the window and we want a head height to be 7 feet so what that is saying is from the head of the window to the ground but that's the finished floor level we want that height to be 7 feet which is actually the same height of our doors and what that will do is that will make our windows and our doors on the same level okay so make sure that we have several feet right here and then everything else looks good so we could actually go ahead and click on the walls that we we want to place this window no remember that there are four of this exact window so we're going to place all four of them at once all right so click on our first one which would be is it here no it's on this wall alright now if you notice the window automatically snaps to the centre of the wall right and that's because we need or I just right here all right so once it looks good we got a click and we go to our second wall looks good 4 feet on each side we click come down to our living era 5 foot 3 on the other side click and then we have another one here one foot on either side we're gonna click so just like that we have already placed for our four windows if let's go ahead and take a look at it and we're gonna just take a look at that so already we have four of our windows in stalled in the drawing not in the actual house all right top view 2d so now we're going to put in our kitchen windows if you notice on the schedule the kitchen window has the same width but the height is a little bit different it's a little shorter and I'm gonna explain why we make it like that in a little bit so let's go ahead it's the same style so we're going to select the glider again and only thing we're gonna change is the width let me see if we have it in here okay so there we go four by three and everything remains the same Center zero Center and we make sure that the head height is also 7 feet and then we're gonna go and we're gonna place it here in the middle of this wall which is what two feet six on either side and we're going to go to this one as well and we're gonna place the other one there now if you look it would appear as if these windows are not there but if I should go in 3d view we can see that clearly they are there so I'm gonna explain to you what is happening here when you look on your drawing from top view what you're seeing is a section let me minimize this what you're seeing is a section through the building so imagine that we take a samurai sword and we slice the building right across here and let's say we slice off the top of the building that's what you're seeing when you look on the top view like this so we slice off the top now we can see the windows doors so what is happening here is that go back to our 3d and so what is happening here is that the cut that was made through the building is below these windows so it's just below these windows so these windows are not gonna be shown in the top view all right but we can actually make an adjustment to that and it's pretty simple so let's go back to our top view and we're gonna make a change so that these windows will now appear so what we would do is to go to what we call the global hot pane all right currently it is at 3 feet 6 inches this 3 feet 6 is actually measuring you know what let me go back to 3d so I can explain it a little better all right so the 3 feet 6 that we're seeing here on our global cut plane our cut height is actually from the ground up so 3 feet 6 up and then it cuts the entire building there now these windows are actually 4 feet from the ground so we would not see these winners in our plan view so all we need to do is to change to push this up a little bit so that this can show so we're gonna make this 4 feet 6 instead of 3 feet 6 and then we're gonna just hit OK and then once we go back to our top view now we can now see those windows showing up so it is as simple as that then we're going to insert our last window which is a horizontal pivot window that is two feet wide by three feet high so let's go ahead and look for that one so do I have a pivot window here so we have a horizontal pivot window right here if you're not seeing it go ahead click on your more tools and search for it and insert it into your drawing so I'm gonna click on it right here go ahead and enter the size to put the two feet by three feet high outside of frame and we're gonna say do we want it in the center yes we want the head height to also be seven feet everything looks good we'll go ahead and we click on our wall and it looks like it is in the center yes one feet six on either side click beautiful so now all our windows are showing in the building and guess what guys that is it for this video that is it so now you know we can't end without looking at our 3d vo all right and I'm gonna spin it around so you can see what we have so far so all our windows are game and all our doors are in alright so earlier I said to you the reason why we normally make the kitchen windows a little bit higher than the regular ones is because inside of the kitchen you're gonna have counter tops and facets and so on and so forth so what we do is to just raise the window a little bit higher so that you have enough space to accommodate all of that also our bathroom windows are normally two by two all right so normally we would have instead of three here we would have two and it would look like a square like that but honestly I don't know why I don't know why they make the bathroom window so small because to me they're too small so I'm gonna leave it at 3 feet right there nothing is wrong with that maybe a too much teeth please oh by the way I wanted to have a little bit of fun with this so just like all we open the door in the plan view we could actually open the doors and the windows in 3d which would be pretty exciting so what you do you click on the door or the window and you would go up to normally we would on on the properties palette you would be on the design alright normally you would change it here for the plan view but for the 3d view we're gonna change it down here and the putting angle so for our door I'm gonna open that door about 45 degrees so you type 45 and now that door is open look at that now I can see inside of my of my living room I could actually walk through that door alright and we could do the same thing for our windows let me open this window so you can see let me say alright 50 percent so now the window is cracked you know you can see a little of what's happening inside there and guess what it did it for all of these windows I think this made more sense oh my god I'm not actually leave it like that No whichever all right but yeah there you go open up the holes make some breeze by two alright so there we have it guys have fun alright guys so thank you for watching this one I hope that you learned something if you have any questions feel free to [Music]",
