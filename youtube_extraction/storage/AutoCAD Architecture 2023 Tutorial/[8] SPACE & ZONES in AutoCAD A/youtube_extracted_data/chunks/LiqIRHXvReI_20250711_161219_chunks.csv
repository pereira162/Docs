0,"all right so thank you for joining me
this is episode 8 of our one bedroom
series and today we're gonna talk about
space so in AutoCAD there is a tool that
is called the space too so as you can
see it can be found right here
and also if you go into the enter the
tool palette and we go to design and if
you scroll down you have the same thing
down here so we're gonna talk about what
it is used for and how to put it in your
drawing make sense I guess so the best
way for me to explain what this space
tool is is to illustrate it so here I
have a box better yet let's make this
box look like something we are familiar
with a building yeah so this is a
one-room building and inside this
one-room building we have nothing and
what we want to do though is to replace
this nothingness with what we call space
its own crazy but I hope that you kind
of get the idea so in AutoCAD what we
would do is to add space within each
room all right and each room is bounded
by the walls that make up that room
okay"
1,"space within each
room all right and each room is bounded
by the walls that make up that room
okay and this space object would be able
to give us a lot of information about
that particular room so for instance we
would be able to name that space such as
let's say the bedroom once we give this
space a name we would also be able to
use autocad's
smart tag to populate the name of the
room when we're ready to annotate the
drawing and also plot the drawing we
would also be able to pull various
information about the room such as the
floor area the volume of the
the parameter of the room also we would
be able to pull the types of finishes
that are being used within that room
whether it be let's say for instance
ceramic tiles on the floor red paints on
the walls
wooden ceilings whatever is in that room
the space tool allows us to capture all
that information and push them into
let's say for instance a schedule all
right so as you can see that the speech
tool becomes very important and very
he"
2,"tance a schedule all
right so as you can see that the speech
tool becomes very important and very
helpful and will save you a lot of time
in the future especially if you're
working on a very large project so let's
move over to AutoCAD where I will show
you how to get this done the last thing
we did was our foundation and what we're
going to do is to go back over to our
floor or ground the floor plan so let's
go back over and of course all of these
can be found in our project navigator
that we have been using all this time so
we have the foundation we would go back
to our ground floor drawing which is
this that is opening open up here and
we're going to go back to the top view
to be so we're going to add spaces to
each of these rooms which is quite
simple we'd go to the Home tab and we go
down to generate space we're gonna use a
generate space because it automatically
identify your boundaries and create a
space within those boundaries for us if
we were to use just a space tool we
would"
3,"ries and create a
space within those boundaries for us if
we were to use just a space tool we
would have two draw boxes two to the
size of your room and that kind of stuff
if you're not seeing it up here we're
gonna go we can find it down here and we
would go down to the space generic tool
right here okay no actually if you go
down the side of this bar we have one
that is dedicated to spaces and inside
of it we have some pre-loaded spaces
that we could actually use but these
were specifically made for office
buildings and
kind of stuff so for instance lobbies
reception stairway corridors that kind
of thing you know so we're not gonna use
those we're gonna just stick with the
one that is up here where we can create
our own space so we're gonna click on
the generate space minimize that zoom in
a little bit and now you can see as I
move the mouse over each room you see a
red box being generated within each room
and what it does is to use the walls as
a boundary for each one okay so before"
4,"ated within each room
and what it does is to use the walls as
a boundary for each one okay so before
we click though what we're gonna do is
to go over to the properties box and
we're gonna make sure that everything is
okay over here so the first thing you
want to do is to change the name of this
space so we're gonna call this the
kitchen enter everything is here looks
good we're gonna go down to the
component dimensions we can change a
couple of things here if we need to all
right so I usually make the surface
height of my space the same height as
the wall okay so the walls on this
building are 10 feet tall so we're gonna
make sure that our surface height is
also 10 feet high once that is set then
we're now clear to go ahead and add
spaces so I'm gonna just go ahead and
add the first piece here that's what it
looks like when you add it so as you go
on at each you want to change the name
as you go along so we're gonna do the
bathroom now we're going to change this
to through click do th"
5,"as you go along so we're gonna do the
bathroom now we're going to change this
to through click do the bedroom
click to the living click and then we're
gonna do porch I mean you can go back
and change these names afterwards it it
doesn't matter all of these you can do
afterwards actually so there we have all
five species being added it hit enter
then we're out of that command so what
I'm gonna do about now is to go into the
3d mode so you can see what's happening
here
x-ray so each room has a space object
inside of it like this box and this box
can give us all the information that we
mentioned earlier in the video such as
the area volume parameter all of that
can be found down here okay area 132
square feet volume 1001 22 cubic feet
parameter it gives you everything and
these can be helpful especially if you
know you're doing a large project and
you would like to know the total area or
the area of our the volume of a
particular space and that kind of stuff
all right it also can be used"
6,"e area of our the volume of a
particular space and that kind of stuff
all right it also can be used to pull
finishes that would be used in that rule
and we would find all of that under what
we call extended beta all right we will
click on this button here to add some
property sets but we're not gonna get
into all of that in this video we're
gonna just stick to the you know just
the regular stuff here and call it that
know what I'm gonna do is to isolate
these objects so just to show you what's
happening here so let's say we select
all and we're gonna isolate them so we
go to this button down here click on it
and we're gonna see isolate
so these are what species look would
look like by themselves all right just
some boxes to fill the the voids
basically all right no AutoCAD actually
gives us the ability to add ceilings
inside of these space and also floor
slab so in the previous video when we
did a floor slab we could actually skip
that step and add the floor slab right
here from the sp"
7,"n we
did a floor slab we could actually skip
that step and add the floor slab right
here from the space object but I wanted
to show you that way as well as this way
and let you decide which one you prefer
to use all right and how do we do that
though in the component dimensions over
here you would see a section for ceiling
height which is already set at 8 feet 6
and what the ceiling thickness is 0 that
is why we're not seeing a ceiling as yet
so let's let's add a ceiling thickness
off I'm gonna give it 2 inches okay and
that would include the ceiling finishing
material as well as the the joist and
all of those stuff so let's say 2 inches
now you can see a ceiling appear within
that space all right and it is at a
height of what 8 feet 6 inches all right
now let's say I want the ceiling to be
in 9 feet up all right
now you can see that the entire thing
goes up above the rest which I don't
want that that would be the space above
the ceiling which would which we can
find right here all rig"
8,"want that that would be the space above
the ceiling which would which we can
find right here all right we can
minimize it here or we can just go back
to our default surface height and put it
back down to 10 feet and I would just
bring it back down to what we want okay
the same thing we can do for floor
thickness so our floor thickness will
actually be 6 inch not 6 feet 6 inch and
just like that we have
of a floor thickness all right so we
could do it here as well but of course
we did that in the previous video so
we're not gonna leave that we're gonna
actually remove that but I'm gonna keep
the ceiling so we're gonna add sealing
to all of these rooms what I would do is
you just click on all of them and just
do one thing yes there are nine feet I'm
gonna add a ceiling thickness of two and
I'm gonna drop this back down to 10 feet
so everybody is on the same height now
of course you could put like say for
instance the bedroom ceiling could be a
little lower or higher depending on how
you"
9,"ut like say for
instance the bedroom ceiling could be a
little lower or higher depending on how
you want it same thing for the kitchen
or the bathroom you can decide and it
all depends on how you are doing your
design so I'm gonna annihilate so we go
to end isolation
now we're having another problem okay in
our 3d view we're seeing the call the
box itself and I don't want us to see
the box I just want the seating alone
and get rid of the box okay so what I'm
gonna do is to hide that layer so what
we will do is to click on it go to edit
style and if you don't see the edit
style button you could actually just
right-click on it and you just edit
style and it brings you to the same spot
okay
and then we would go over to the volume
option and we're gonna override this
photo again we're getting into some deep
stuff but no worry self you'll get the
hang of it and what we do is basically
just turn it off turn off the visibility
of that entity okay now we hit OK and
just like that it is God bec"
10,"rn it off turn off the visibility
of that entity okay now we hit OK and
just like that it is God because at the
end of the day we don't want to see that
space when we're gonna print the drawing
okay it is just there to give us the
information that we need it is still
there in the background what we don't
want to see it so now you can see that
we have our ceiling and we can actually
see inside of the house actually let me
put this in unsexual so you can see what
is happening all right so the horse
actually was ceiling to come together
nicely man alright so let's go back to
the top view and to the way through also
when we are printing the drawing we do
not want to see these hatch lines so we
could actually hide these hatch lines or
put them on a layer that will not print
how do you do that simply click on it
and we would go to edit style again
where is it
edit style and we would go to the plan
view we're gonna over edit and these two
top ones we're gonna actually put them
on a layer that"
11,"plan
view we're gonna over edit and these two
top ones we're gonna actually put them
on a layer that will not print so when
you go to print them they won't show
on the people so you put them on a deaf
point there cuz we all know that the
Deaf point layer does not print okay
at that point I'm gonna put this one a
deaf point as well gonna hit okay and
you could do the same thing for the high
low details but I'm gonna just do the
that one and I'm going to leave it there
and I hit okay so even though you're
seeing it here on this drawing when you
go to print it you will not see it okay
and that's important because we don't
want it all these hatching and all of
that in the drawing when we're going to
print it alright the last thing I want
to show you is how to separate a space
without a wall so like this living area
i I kind of want to break this area into
two but there is no wall to break that
area so what I'm gonna do is to draw a
line here using the space separator
alright this tool righ"
12,"at
area so what I'm gonna do is to draw a
line here using the space separator
alright this tool right here so I will
just click on it and now we can go ahead
and draw the line where we want the
space to be divided so I'm gonna draw a
line from here I'm gonna start it on the
edge of the wall come across and I'm
gonna kind of track it down like so
click on that X then we're gonna bring
it up like that and I'm gonna hit enter
just like that this space kill them
let's go down here know what should
happen here is that this this error
should be divided into two sections but
it didn't happen and I think I know why
what we're gonna do is go back to our
edit style because we had turned off the
volume that's the problem there so what
we're going to do is turn it back on
and we're gonna put it again on a layer
that doesn't print so let's put it on a
deaf point layer and we're gonna turn
down the transparency all the way to 90
cuz when we're going to 3d we don't want
to see the space at all
so we"
13,"ansparency all the way to 90
cuz when we're going to 3d we don't want
to see the space at all
so we want to make it as transparent as
possible even though it is still there
so initially we had turned it off so
that's why the separation tool is not
working so we're gonna say okay okay and
we're gonna redo this so let's do it
again separate I'm gonna click bring it
down I'm gonna just hover over that
point so that I can get that a tracking
line now click there and move over click
once you draw the lines where you want
it just hit enter and that should give
you two separate species just like that
all right so what we're gonna do now is
to rename this space and we could call
it no I will not call it passage
something like that and we're gonna call
this well it's a living already we're
just gonna remove the tool from off of
it and so we have our species just like
that
so we're going to go back to 3d go back
to x-ray mode
so now we can see that the species are
still there but there are kind"
14,"k to 3d go back
to x-ray mode
so now we can see that the species are
still there but there are kind of
transparent especially the box itself
yeah it's very very transparent alright
alright guys so by the way you guys
don't forget to hit the Save button also
don't forget to hit the like button
yes ma'am I like what let see them so
all right so let's hit the safe one
first and then we're gonna go down and
hit the black one okay so that wraps it
up for this video I hope that you'll
learn something if you have any
questions at all any questions with
regards to space art cut those drop them
in the comments okay
and don't forget to hit the like button
and if you haven't already subscribed
alright so thanks again for watching and
I respect"
