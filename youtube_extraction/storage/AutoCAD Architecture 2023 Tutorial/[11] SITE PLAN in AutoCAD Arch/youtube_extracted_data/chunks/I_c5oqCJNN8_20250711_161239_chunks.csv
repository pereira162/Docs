0,"hi everyone this is episode 11 for one
bedroom house
series and today what we're gonna do is
to start working on our site plan so
what that means is that we're gonna lay
out what I want is site to look like
we're gonna do some landscape word plant
some trees some grass and a couple look
at things you know to make it look like
somewhere we would actually want to live
[Music]
okay so drawing your side plant can be
another fun activity so on a side plan
you get the opportunity to make the
landscape exactly how you want it to
look so we get to add a various trees
shrubs edging gardens driveway pavements
pools etc etc but for today's
demonstration I'm gonna make it very
simple we're gonna just do the basic
stuff and I might just add one or two
little thing here and there but nothing
too deep I leave that for you to
experiment all right
now the question is why do we need a
site plan the site plan is actually a
very important plan and the Municipal
Corporation will need this drawing in
order"
1,"lan is actually a
very important plan and the Municipal
Corporation will need this drawing in
order to know where the building is
located on the site they want to know if
you are abiding by setbacks and zoning
regulations they want to see you how the
drainage is laid hope they wanna see
what the landscape looks like all of
that they want to see also the site plan
is being used by the contractor because
when the contractor is ready to lay out
the building he will need to know where
to start laying on the billion euros
that the site plan is also used by
landscapers the guys who are gonna come
in and plant the trees they need to know
where to plant which tree we're to put
the pavement and our
that kind of stuff Meza and also later
on the home owner might want to do
additions to the building or to sell the
property and this side plan would be
required to do any of these tasks all
right now with all of that said let's
get over into AutoCAD and see what we
can do over there alright guys so h"
2,"ith all of that said let's
get over into AutoCAD and see what we
can do over there alright guys so here
we are back in the drawing so if you
remember when we set up the project from
day one we had created a property
boundary construct and it would have
been in this drawing that we would have
created our property boundary all right
so let's let me open this drawing up and
as you can see here I already have a
layout of the property that we're going
to be placing the building on I recently
did a video on how to do this so if you
don't know how to do it
oh and watch that video so the diagram
would be found on the surveys report and
we would use the the bearings and the
distance is provided by the surveyor to
get this diagram because we need to make
sure that it is as accurate as possible
all right no the first part of this
video that I'm gonna be doing should
have been done from even before we
started to do the ground floor and the
foundation alright this is something
that I I overlooked i"
3,"we
started to do the ground floor and the
foundation alright this is something
that I I overlooked in the beginning of
this project so what I'm gonna be doing
is to split this video into so what I'm
gonna do first is to show you what we
should have done from the beginning of
the project and then in Part 2 or the
second half of this video I'm gonna be
showing what we would do after which
would be at this point in the in the
project alright alright so after we have
the the drawing the diagram looking like
this what we would do is - first thing I
would say set the scale so make sure
that your scale is 1/8 and this is
equivalent to 1 in 100 if you're using
millimeters as your units this is like
that the regular scale that we use
because the building is really small if
you had a very large building then we
would probably go for one in 16 which
would be the same as 1 in 200 and so on
and so forth all right so we're gonna
work with one it perfect and the second
thing we're gonna do is to crea"
4,"rth all right so we're gonna
work with one it perfect and the second
thing we're gonna do is to create some
layers alright remember that we're going
to be placing trees pavement and so on
so I want to create a layer for all of
these elements alright so I have my
layers palette right here if you don't
know where to find it it is right here
and this little guy right here layer
properties and I actually have a video
on how to create layers so if you don't
know how to create layers check that
video out but for this video I'm gonna
just go right ahead and create some
layers I'm gonna put a s before all of
them just to say this is a layer that is
on a site plan so the S represents site
all right put a - and the first one I'm
gonna create is the property line I'm
gonna change the color to blue maybe
that you can choose the color you want
we usually use Phantom for the line type
and the line Oita I'm gonna just set it
at probably point 4 then I'll create a
new one call this one setback and I'm"
5,"a I'm gonna just set it
at probably point 4 then I'll create a
new one call this one setback and I'm
gonna make this one red and I'm gonna
change it from phantom to - and I'm
gonna make the line wait a little bit
promise 13 I think all the others are
gonna be 0.13 so create another one call
this one pavement enter I'm going to
give this a gray color
and I'm gonna make this continuous and
I'm gonna leave it on the 13 create
another one call this one vegetation and
of course the vegetation would be some
sorta green color continuous 13 perfect
and then I'm gonna create one last one
I'm gonna call this one the road and of
course you can choose whichever color
you would like and the line width is
just about what I have here you can work
with the language but that's for the
hour for the line type and the color I
would say try to adopt these ones until
you're able to come up with your own
style and technique alright so so far we
can see now that we have all of these
layers inside of our drop-"
6,"and technique alright so so far we
can see now that we have all of these
layers inside of our drop-down here so
the first thing we're going to do is to
draw the road so let's go to the road
layer and of course we want to represent
as close as possible the width of the
road and if there's a sidewalk and that
kind of thing so for this for this
diagram I'm gonna put a sidewalk of five
feet all right and the road width would
be 18 feet and these would depend on the
area alright so if it is a city area you
know you would have a wider street and
maybe a wider sidewalk and if it's a
more residential rural here you'd have a
narrower street and a narrower sidewalk
and you might have sidewalks on both
side or on one side whatever the case
may be alright so make sure you go on
the side and you try to get an accurate
measurement and so what I'm gonna do now
is to just offset well draw a line first
here now let's turn the artha more on
like that
well this kind of stretch it out a
little bit furthe"
7,"here now let's turn the artha more on
like that
well this kind of stretch it out a
little bit further off of the back now
what I'm gonna do is to offset the
sidewalk from this line so I'm gonna
make it five feet away from that
then I'm gonna offset another 18 feet
which would be the width off the road so
let's do a sit again 18 feet enter and
then that would be the width of the road
of course we could add another sidewalk
here but I don't care about this side of
the road I want to care about this side
right now so I'm gonna leave it right
there what I'm gonna do is to get the
center line in the middle of the road
though because that's gonna be an
important line that we will need later
on in this video all right so we're
gonna do another offset and the middle
of that road would actually be 9 feet
all right so there we have our 9 feet
and I'm gonna actually change the line
type here to dashed so that it looks
like our road would look of course the
dashed line would mean you can overtake"
8,"hed so that it looks
like our road would look of course the
dashed line would mean you can overtake
here which we don't know really all
right so at this point we can see that
we have the road what I'm gonna do here
now is to change this property box to
move it over to the current layer which
will be the property line there and then
we're I'm gonna explode it so I can work
on each line individually what I'm gonna
do also is to trim out this orange piece
off the road so I can see the property
boundary underneath so I go to the trim
tool
shrim I think this is it shrimp now I'm
gonna select this and this enter and
then we want to trim this guy out so
just like that we can now see the
property boundary underneath all right
so from here what we're gonna do is to
put our setbacks boundary in all right
so for this drawing of a dis property
the setbacks are 5 feet from the sides
both sides 15 feet from the back and 20
feet from the center of the road on the
front all right now these information"
9,"t from the back and 20
feet from the center of the road on the
front all right now these information
again you would get from your local
authorities these are very critical
information and I will explain some more
later on in this video so what I'm gonna
do is to do some more offsets again
notice we using the offset to very
regularly here so we're gonna offset 15
feet
on the back okay then it's gonna be
another offset which would be five feet
on the sides all right just like that
and then it should be twenty feet from
the center of the road so let's do
another offset twenty feet from the
center line that is why we needed the
centerline
all right so in Jamaica they use the
centerline at the front of the building
or the front of the property I'm not
sure if that's how they do it in other
countries but the reason for this is so
that if in the future the government
decides to widen the street everyone on
this particular street would have the
the amount of space necessary for that
future de"
10,"t everyone on
this particular street would have the
the amount of space necessary for that
future development all right so this is
very important as we can see here is
that we have a space within the property
all right I'm gonna actually highlight
this space using the setback layer that
we created earlier so I'm gonna use a
setback layer and I'm gonna go to
polyline and draw just an outline around
this space
like so enter and then I'm gonna
actually delete or erase these guys now
cuz I don't need them anymore
alright enter so here we have the red
box telling us that we can only build
within these boundaries even though you
have your whole property you buy your
land but guess what you're only allowed
to build within the sandbox and this is
very important and there are many
reasons all right for this particular
property let's say you have a river
running behind it if you watch the video
on how to draw this you would have seen
that there's a river running behind here
and so they want to e"
11,"how to draw this you would have seen
that there's a river running behind here
and so they want to ensure that you
build far away enough because if the
river should let's say take away a piece
of the land then your house would be
safe alright we explain the front
already and also on the sides they want
to make sure that you have adequate
space away from the boundary so that
your neighbor you're building the
sapphic your neighbor and vice versa so
it's different in other areas those in
some areas you're allowed to build as
close to the to the boundary especially
if it is a condensed area like cities
and so on so it all varies you just need
to find out what the setbacks are in
whatever are whichever area you're gonna
be doing the building for alright so we
need to ensure that whatever we're gonna
design can fit within this space here
and we're talking about the main
building itself so if you have another
like a accessory building that's
different that can be at least much
closer or anywh"
12,"ou have another
like a accessory building that's
different that can be at least much
closer or anywhere else on the property
for instance if you have an attached
garage or let's say a dog house our pig
pen whatever the case may be those other
things can be anywhere else but when it
comes to the main building itself it has
to be placed within
six bucks all right so this is where
part 1 of this video would end this is
what you would do before you start to
draw anything alright so let's move over
into the second half of this video all
right so now that we have everything
here and we have the set back and what
I'm gonna do is to place the building
inside of the setback area all right but
first let me connect these back together
so I'm gonna use the join command and
let's join these guys back together so I
can get like a single object like that
good alright so we're going to go over
to our project navigator
and with an xref the ground floor into
this drawing alright so over here we can
see"
13,"oject navigator
and with an xref the ground floor into
this drawing alright so over here we can
see that we have the ground floor and
what I'm gonna do is - I don't want to
move this drawing because this is an X
reference file try not to move this all
right what I'm gonna do is to move all
of this over to the building so I'm
gonna say all right use a move tool and
I'm gonna move it from this edge right
here all the way over to to the edge of
this building right there I notice that
there is a slider
something is off right there I think
this should go there right like that all
right so I'm gonna move this over and
I'm gonna drag it from this corner all
the way over let me turn off my Arthur
model so that it lines up with the edge
of this building so just like that I
know that my walls are within the Sigma
here alright if the roof hang over a
little bit that's fine don't worry about
the roof what you should worry about are
the walls you want to make sure that
your walls are within the set"
14,"f what you should worry about are
the walls you want to make sure that
your walls are within the set back here
if you have a pavement going over that's
fine but the main building itself has to
be within
set back here now let's take a closer
look and to make sure that everything is
within the set but now if i zoom in here
you can see that we have a breach right
in this corner here and that's because
this side of the property is actually
running at a slight angle so as it goes
up we can see that it gets closer and
closer so I don't think this amount of
breach would put in much of a trouble
all right so what I'm gonna do is to
move the property over some more so you
want to make sure that you don't move
the building so make sure you're on high
like that if that's a word so I'm gonna
move understand I'm gonna move it using
the our thumb order as well so I'm gonna
move it over a little bit like so so
that this side is no within setbacks and
now also if you notice this part of the
wall is al"
15,"ke so so
that this side is no within setbacks and
now also if you notice this part of the
wall is also within it by the way guys
you are allowed to use the entire space
alright so if you want to make the
building as big as the space itself it's
up to you but of course I want to have a
driveway here and plant a couple trees
and so on and so forth so we're gonna
leave it right there we know that we're
in the safe zone and from here we are
going to hide this layer because now I'm
doing with the setbacks so numbers hide
it escape let me make this 0 layer
active I'm gonna hide this layer I think
this is also on the setback layer which
is not what I want I want to put this
under zero later so let's get that out
of the way alright so now that we have
everything let's look at it in 3d and
see what we have
alright so so far you can see that we
have something that looks not too shabby
alright so now what I'm gonna do is to
add the driveway and
and let's see where we get from there so
we're going"
16,"ow what I'm gonna do is to
add the driveway and
and let's see where we get from there so
we're going to shift over to pavement
layer and we're gonna do some drawing so
I'm gonna draw from the edge here this
is where I want my driveway to stop I
mean you can make it your own
11 feet wide maybe could go a little
wider pull this all the way down to the
side of the road like that and then I'm
gonna give another line you wanna draw a
nice front step out pavement here maybe
six feet out and come across like this
and then I'm gonna just line that up
with that column and bring it down to
the curb here alright so this is gonna
be the driveway so I'll Drive up park
here step out go inside do what I gotta
do and so on alright and I have a
lassika step on here here what we're
gonna do is to kind of give it a little
curve so let's use the filete tool and
let's say we want the radius to be
twelve inches and we're gonna do
multiple because we're gonna have
multiple of these so let's give these
edges"
17,"es and we're gonna do
multiple because we're gonna have
multiple of these so let's give these
edges some fill it just you know make it
look somewhat give it a lick of flair
alright we're gonna do the same thing
here I'm gonna use a three feet radius
for this portion three feet and I don't
know the standard if you know the
standard drop it down below what the
standard curve should be what I'm gonna
use three feet nothing the car our vicar
can make that turn if you notice it took
away the line on this side so I'm gonna
have to draw another
and do the same thing again and then of
course I'm gonna have to close this back
right here this line and this line
should be on the road there all right so
we have the road we have the pavement
coming in park here and we have an
icicle front step out here what I'm
gonna do is to give this curb a
thickness and I'm gonna give it four
inches I think that's the typical with
off a curb so let's do the offset come
on and we're gonna say four inches now I
th"
18,"the typical with
off a curb so let's do the offset come
on and we're gonna say four inches now I
think I did four feet there let's go
again four and just give this a lesson
of thickness to now just to make it look
something like you know like a curb or
like that edge you don't have to do this
again so go on Google look on there are
many ways to make a site plan look look
nice alright so I'm going to leave it
there and then what I'm gonna also do is
to draw a box around this using the Box
tool of course if you had an irregular
shape building you would want to use the
polyline tool but since this is a
rectangular I'm gonna just use a
rectangle tool and the reason I'm doing
this is because I can no detach the
holes are unloaded rather and I would
have this air telling me where exactly
the house is located alright at this
point we can go ahead and place our
trees or cars and so on what before I do
that what I'm gonna do is to hatch these
areas so we're understand the pavement
so good so w"
19,"re I do
that what I'm gonna do is to hatch these
areas so we're understand the pavement
so good so what I'm gonna do is to go to
the hatch tool this is just to add some
additional texture and patterns to your
drawing to make it look you know good we
don't have to do this so let's go down
and click on the drop down here and from
here you can decide all right
it's it gonna be a concrete pavement or
is it gonna be some sort of brick layout
it's up to you to decide so we have an
icicle brick layout here or we could use
this herringbone pattern style all right
so let's try this one and I'm gonna make
the pavement of that style so I'm gonna
do here and here as you can see we have
an icicle pavement right there
and then we could do the grass as well
so let's say we go down to the
vegetation layer and we're gonna hatch
again and this time we're gonna select
something that says or something that
look more like a grass like this and
we're gonna say all right in now this is
very very fine so we c"
20,"look more like a grass like this and
we're gonna say all right in now this is
very very fine so we could actually make
it a little bit bigger by changing the
number here so let's say we made this
ten all right go ahead and click that
looks a little but so we're gonna work
with that for now and so far we have
something that looks like that and at
this point we can go ahead and drop on
some additional things like trees cars
tables whatever you feel like you want
to add of course I'm just gonna be doing
the bare basic on here and also you
would want to show your drainage layout
and your septic tank your manholes all
of those will be shown on this drawing
that's what we do it in Jamaica in other
places what they would do is to have a a
different site plan for different
services but for this we're gonna drop
everything on here alright so what we're
gonna do is to add some trees and of
course if there were trees on the site
already and you want to keep that tree
then you would want to repres"
21,"if there were trees on the site
already and you want to keep that tree
then you would want to represent it on
the side plan in the similar location
all right but for this one we're gonna
plan some brand new trees so let's go
and find some trees all right now I'm
gonna actually use some 3d trees we can
use 2d I would actually recommend you
use the 2d ones as well just so that it
doesn't take up too much power off of
your computer
all right so we go into the content
browser as usual and we go down to site
and we're going to planting and from
here you see all the different types of
trees these ones that look 3d are
actually in 3d so I'm gonna choose
probably like this one I'm gonna say
insert and I'm gonna drop probably one
here all right you don't want to plant
it on the edge cuz guess what its gonna
go all the way over to people property
and that kind of thing so you don't want
to have your trees growing all over and
people please love to do that kind of
stuff alright so let us drop in"
22,"ur trees growing all over and
people please love to do that kind of
stuff alright so let us drop in some
trees all over the place and I'm gonna
try and drop another type maybe this one
drop this one probably like right here
on the front then let me see if I can
find another type a drop one more tree
in the back probably alright so these
are all the trees I'm gonna plant and
guess what we can take a look at it in
3d then this is what they would actually
look like alright so I'm not gonna do
anything else here
to be actually what I'm gonna do is add
a car so I'm gonna go back to site and
then I'm gonna go to basic vehicle and
you have to DV codes as well as 3d let's
go over even have trucks for those of
you who truck people so I'm gonna drop
this car here or maybe the station wagon
no compact car
it's a one-man hose a one-man I drive so
I'm going to insert I'm gonna just
rotate this 90 degrees and I'm gonna
drop it right in the spot here and just
like that we have the car beautiful and
n"
23,"rees and I'm gonna
drop it right in the spot here and just
like that we have the car beautiful and
now we have everything in 3d just like
that alright and if I go to concept well
you can have a better look at what this
would look like all right and of course
these these are the only things I'm
gonna be doing in 3d you could actually
model it the pavement and curb and try
to get everything all 3d alright but I'm
gonna leave it right here cuz this is
enough for a drawing to be submitted to
Parrish console what I'm gonna do is to
reload it the house so I'm gonna go to
my X references and reload so you can
see what it actually looks like with the
house I'm gonna see perspective so we
can have an idea what everything would
look like when it's all done alright so
as I turn this around so you can see
what we have
in the next video I will be combining
all the views so the foundation plus the
ground floor and site I'm going to put
everything together and then we can
start to create our elevatio"
24,"und floor and site I'm going to put
everything together and then we can
start to create our elevation views
sectional views and plan views and all
of those alright and of course I know
that
really and truly if you look the ground
is on the same level as the finished
floor level inside which is not supposed
to be the case all right
this should be six inches down which we
are going to be addressing also in that
video all right so don't worry about
that for this I just want to see how it
would look and looks just about what we
want it and of course I expect you to
customize yours the way you want alright
so if you want a pool in the front of
your house or if you want I don't know a
water fountain whatever just make it
your own do it how you want to do it
alright now for the plan view this is
what I should have shown you if you
notice we're still seeing inside of the
building if it is that you want to not
see inside of the building or you just
want to look at the roof itself of
course what"
25,"ou want to not
see inside of the building or you just
want to look at the roof itself of
course what we would do is to raise the
global cut plane from three feet six to
anything above the roof so let's say 20
feet that would be above the roof
alright now what I would do is to raise
the cut plane from below to above the
roof so now this is something more like
what you would want to see on a side
plan if you don't want to see inside the
building we can always move it to
conceptual or hidden so let's do that
just like that we can see that we're
having a bird's-eye view looking
straight down on the building or on the
property
alright so later on when we start to add
annotations and dimensions and so on and
so to this drawing we will be adding the
drainage layout and also a lot of other
information will be
to this drawing all right so that's the
end of this video what was done today
was just enough to get us through the
gate and I really didn't want to make
this video any longer so I hope t"
26,"enough to get us through the
gate and I really didn't want to make
this video any longer so I hope that you
learned something just explore all right
and make your site plan look as unique
and especially how you'd like and you
know go on Google and loop on some other
site plans and get some ideas and
inspirations so I hope that you learned
something if you have any questions you
know the drill I really drop them in the
comments and also don't forget to
subscribe don't forget to hit the like
one and yeah you have a good week
[Music]"
