0,"hi so this is episode 10 of our
one-bedroom house series and in this
video today what we're gonna do is to
install some fridge so my plans is you
know some some some equipment and thing
inside our house today but this is
probably the easiest thing and probably
the most fun thing to do and yeah let's
get right into it
[Music]
okay now the areas of focus for this
video will be the kitchen and the
bathroom since these areas are needed in
order to submit your drawings now I hear
you ask the question why the kitchen and
the bathroom now these areas will have
fixed or what we call stationary items
that will not move for years or if ever
things like cabinet stove fridge
counters stuff like those also we will
need to do a drainage plan which means
that we need to show where the drain
line runs from the kitchen and the
bathroom to the sewage are the waste
water system all right so these are
needed in order to complete your drawing
the other areas such as bedroom living
room and those other area"
1,"d in order to complete your drawing
the other areas such as bedroom living
room and those other areas are not as
important
since the items in these areas are not
necessarily stationary you know you can
rearrange the living room you can
rearrange your bedroom but the kitchen
and the bathroom can really move
anything around really not to say that
you should add like a bed or a couch in
those areas but it's not a requirement
by the state get nothing anyways I know
you've been waiting so you know what
let's stop talking and let's get right
into it
okay so as you can see on this drawing
that I have prepared ahead of time this
is how we want to arrange our fixtures
and
furniture to look something like this as
you can see I have provided some
instructions for you where to find each
of these items within the content
browser so if you follow these
instructions you will be fine and you
can also explore the content browser to
find other things that you might like
and want to try out alright
so wi"
2,"plore the content browser to
find other things that you might like
and want to try out alright
so without further ado let's get
cracking so we could actually add these
items in this drawing right here alright
so currently we're in the ground floor
drawing we could add everything inside
here but I don't want us to do that I
want us to create a brand new drawing
and add the fixtures in those drawing
just like we did with the foundation we
have the foundation in a separate
drawing let me show you that so we have
the foundation in a separate drawing we
have the ground floor in a separate
drawing now we're going to add the
fixtures and furniture in a separate
drawing how by creating a brand new
construct so let's do that
alright so we go down to new now we say
construct and we're gonna call this fix
chairs or furniture whatever you want to
call it you can give it a description if
you want whatever and then we would
select what level do we want these items
to be added to we're gonna say of c"
3,"tever and then we would
select what level do we want these items
to be added to we're gonna say of course
the ground floor we're not gonna add
them to the foundation that would be
crazy and we could go ahead and open the
drawing so as we click OK you can see
that a brand new drawing was created for
us to add these items in but how can you
add them when you can't even see the
house itself to know where to place each
item and guess what that's where we go
over here and we're gonna xref overlay
into this drawing so again go to the
ground floor right click go down to
x-ray overlay and just like that we have
the ground floor inside of our fixtures
drawing alright now this comes in as a
block by itself we cannot do any edits
to this inside of this
and that's amazing so let me minimize
this and what I'm gonna do is to pull
this over to this side so I can have the
drawing over here as a reference so we
can look at it together alright so the
first thing we're gonna do is to add our
base cabinet"
4,"e so we
can look at it together alright so the
first thing we're gonna do is to add our
base cabinets and then we're gonna add
the wall cabinets second and then we add
the stove fridge sink and then count it
up so that's the order in which we're
going to be doing things so the first
thing I want to do is to go to your
content browser and we would go into
imperial as usual if you're doing metric
this is where you would go so we're
going to be going to imperial and
following the instructions on the sheet
we would go to furnishing and we go to
furniture sorry let's go back we're
going to casework and the first base
cabinet we're gonna add is from this
category and it would be 24 inches wide
which would be this guy right here so
when I drop in drop it right here
alright so we have our first cabinet
installed let's take a look at it cuz I
know you're curious doesn't know what
this thing looks like so that's what it
looks like in the corner over there and
we're gonna keep adding them coming"
5,"like so that's what it
looks like in the corner over there and
we're gonna keep adding them coming
around like that so let's go back to the
top view I so we're going to be adding
the second one which is a 12-inch one
with some drawers inside of it so know
what the keys work and we're gonna go
base with jars and this is it insert and
just like that we drop it right here so
it's almost like we're placing building
blocks on top of each other the third
one is gonna be the big one which will
house the sink so we're going to go back
to casework and this one will not have
any drawers on it so go back to base
cabinet and this one should be 36 inches
wide so I'm going to insert that one and
we're gonna drop him right there just
like that I don't know if you realize
how easy this is then we're gonna go and
drop in a corner one right here alright
it is important that you layout your
kitchen and your bathroom before you
start to do this have an idea what
you're doing so that when you start to
wor"
6,"ur bathroom before you
start to do this have an idea what
you're doing so that when you start to
work you can work smoothly so we're
going to be dropping the corner one
we're going to the corner folder and we
have a corner base which is what we're
going to be adding so we would drop it
here again but guess what it is in the
wrong orientation so we need to rotate
this one 270 degrees just like that we
can don't drop it in the corner right
here so now we have one side completed
we're gonna drop in next one here which
is a thirty inch wide with drawers so we
need to go here and we need to find
thirty inch with drawers and again all
of these will need to be rotated 270
degrees and we're gonna drop it right
there and then lastly we have one in the
corner here which is a 12-inch one so
here it is insert and we're gonna rotate
it alright so now we could place it but
guess what the cursor is on the wrong
side so I'm gonna click and drop it
first and then I'll move it over using
the move tool t"
7,"the wrong
side so I'm gonna click and drop it
first and then I'll move it over using
the move tool to place it in a corner
like that so there we now have our base
cabinet if you want to see what it looks
like of course we could just do like
that and you can see them in the
background there alright let's go back
to the top view alright so we're going
to add the wall cabinets no before I add
those if you notice I am not seeing the
windows on this side and if you remember
in a previous video I would have shown
you how to see your windows I'm gonna be
doing it again so we would go to what is
called a global quarter plane and we
would actually just raise this number up
to four
feet six inches and that should be good
to show those windows we want to know
where exactly the wall cabinet should
stop for this drawing I wanted to stop
on the edge of the window okay so from
the corner of the wall to the edge of
the window which is 24 inches if I
should measure it not 24 30 inches
rather right 2 fe"
8,"the edge of
the window which is 24 inches if I
should measure it not 24 30 inches
rather right 2 feet 6 inches that would
equal to 30 inches so we need something
that is 30 inches wide so let's go back
and go to casework and at the top here
we will find all of our wall cabinets we
have some that are sharp and some that
are tall depending on where you want to
place it you know you have some short
ones above the stove or above the
refrigerator that kind of thing I'm
gonna be sticking with the regular
30-inch ones and we need one that is 30
inches wide as well so I'm gonna insert
it just like this we can drop it right
in the corner of the window like that
and that's good and then we're gonna
drop our second one down here in this
corner right here so just like that we
have our wall cabinets installed all
right so if I should go back to 3d you
can see them here actually you know what
let's go to our X reference palette and
if you don't know where this is you can
go to this paperclip icon d"
9,"o to our X reference palette and
if you don't know where this is you can
go to this paperclip icon down here or
type the command X ref and it would
bring you to this palette now what we
can actually do is to hide the house
itself so let's go to unload the house
and just like that we can focus on the
furniture themselves all right and we're
gonna do this for the remainder of the
kitchen well maybe not know let's turn
it back on
reload go back to top view I'm gonna add
the stove and the refrigerator now so
let's go back to here and we're gonna go
to
to log and we're gonna go equipment
foodservice range we're gonna add this
one inside so let's go to insert into
our drawing and then I'm gonna rotate it
I'm trying to move as quickly as
possible because I don't want is we need
to be too long
alright so click on it I'm gonna move it
into its position so move it from here
to there
alright and then we're gonna be adding
the sink over here well before we add
this thing let's add the refrigerator"
10,"en we're gonna be adding
the sink over here well before we add
this thing let's add the refrigerator
cause I think it's in the same place
here refrigerator we want to add this
one insert you need to rotate this one
90 degrees and we're gonna drop it right
on this wall right there looks just
about good and lastly we need to add the
sink so let's go back to catalog
mechanical plumbing sink and this is the
one that I want to use you can go ahead
and choose the one that you would prefer
this is a small house so I'm gonna
choose a single sink and I'm gonna drop
it right in the middle right there okay
alright so what I'm gonna do is to go
back to 3d and I'm going to unload the
house so that we can focus on just these
items now if you'll notice I'm put it in
concept well we do not have a countertop
that's because you have to create your
own called the top alright and also if
you notice the sink is on the floor
which is nuts
alright so what we need to do is to move
the elevation of the sink up"
11,"is on the floor
which is nuts
alright so what we need to do is to move
the elevation of the sink up to 3 feet
all right so just like that we have the
sink
coming up as you can see we would add
our countertop to flush with the sink on
top of there
all right so we're gonna do that now
let's go back to our top view and 2d
wireframe at this point I don't need to
reload the house so I'm gonna just work
with it like this the same tool that we
used to draw the floor is the same tool
we're gonna be using to draw our
countertop
and the reason for that is with a slab
you can make it any material you want
that's how other card works so we can
make it granite we can make it plastic
we can make it would we can make it
whatever you want so we're gonna use the
slab tool as you can see right here and
we're gonna make sure that it is 2
inches thick and everything else looks
like this over here and then we're gonna
go ahead and start to draw our way
around so let's start at this corner
we're gonna go t"
12,"we're gonna
go ahead and start to draw our way
around so let's start at this corner
we're gonna go this way make our way
around I'm gonna go back here when you
reach the sink we want to go around the
sink so let's do that going around the
sink and we're gonna click right here
enter alright now we're gonna add
another one over here
enter and just like that we have our
countertops so let's look at that again
in 3d now as you can see our countertops
are at the bottom of the the thing again
which is crazy so what do you think we
need to do we need to raise the
elevation so let's do that over here
elevation three feet so the height of a
countertop is typically three feet so
that is why we put the elevation at
three feet so now you can see that our
sink is lying nice and flush on top of
the countertop and everything is looking
premium proper
the only issue we have now is that the
countertop should have a overhang let me
show you so this piece the countertop
should be hanging over a little bi"
13,"ould have a overhang let me
show you so this piece the countertop
should be hanging over a little bit into
the kitchen so that's the only thing
that we have left to fix here in the
kitchen let's go back to 2d and it's
easy to fix all we need to do is to
click on the countertop itself
now we're gonna drag this arrow out like
so and we're gonna type to enter just
like that it is now two inches hanging
over the cabinets
alright we're gonna do the same thing
with this just click on the arrow drag
it out type two - we're gonna do the
same thing here
- alright so I don't know if you can see
it but I'm gonna put it in 3d concept
well so now you can see that we have a
slight overhang of the countertop over
the cabinet and that's exactly what we
want
so our kitchen is done all we need to do
now is to add our bathroom elements so
I'm gonna be doing that at this point
I'm gonna kind of speed
you up so because you kind of get the ID
and the gist of what's happening here
what I'm gonna do is to rel"
14,"so because you kind of get the ID
and the gist of what's happening here
what I'm gonna do is to reload the house
so that we can see where the bathroom is
so that we can place our items so we're
gonna go back to content browser and
we're already in the plumbing section of
the hardware so first thing we need to
add is a toilet and we're gonna use this
one you can choose the one that you want
to use I'm using this one and of course
we need to rotate it so let's do that
over here 270 degrees and I'm gonna drop
him okay I did not mention this before
but this bathroom is what we call a wet
bathroom which means that the entire
bathroom area in inside of this space
here is the shower area so there is no
bathtub and that kind of thing the
entire room is the shower area even
though the toilet is in there still
alright so if you don't know what a wet
bathroom is you can actually Google it
up and see some other examples so what
we're gonna do is add a shower header
right here
let's go back to the"
15,"ee some other examples so what
we're gonna do is add a shower header
right here
let's go back to the content browser go
to plumbing and we go to shower and we
have a showerhead right here so we're
gonna be dropping him right on this wall
just for just about here and of course
we're gonna raise the elevation from
zero because right now it is on the
floor from zero to about eight feet I
think eight feet is a good height I'm
gonna be adding a drain in the middle
here or wherever you want to add yours
so go back to plumbing drain floor drain
I'm gonna be dropping it right in the
center here this might not be the best
location let me drop it over to this
side so that's our dream and lastly
let's add our lavatory affection let me
call this basin so let's go back to
plumbing and we go to lavatory and
inside here we can find different types
of facepiece okay we can we have these
that doesn't have a base and of course
we could add a base to it just like we
did with the kitchen so you'd go to
ca"
16,"e a base and of course
we could add a base to it just like we
did with the kitchen so you'd go to
cabinet and find a nice cabinet to place
it on what we're going to find one that
I already have everything which is this
one right here
I'm gonna just drop it in the dryer make
life a little easier for this video
all right now we're gonna drop it right
in the center of that wall and just like
that we have everything placed for the
bathroom and the kitchen so let's look
at that in 3d and of course I'm gonna
hide the house so that we can focus on
these guys right here
we have the showerhead we have the
toilet and we also have for face basin
so everything is looking good for these
areas and as I said before these areas
are the two most important areas that we
must complete in order to complete a
drawing so bear that in mind I'm not
going to be doing the other areas I'm
going to leave those to you but you can
follow the diagram that I have here
explore the other options and go ahead
and make i"
