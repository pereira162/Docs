  "full_text": "hello I want a two-bedroom house I want a three-bedroom I want a six bedroom with seven bathroom and a pool hi everyone thank you for joining me on another YouTube video it's been a while a lot of things has been happening and you know I just didn't have the time but I really want to do this so I am back at it and it's all for you guys this has been a passion in my heart to share what I know because I know that there are a lot of persons who would like to learn at least the basics as I only know the basics alright so thank you for joining me on this video so in today's video I'll be teaching you my method of drawing a house from start to finish print and ready to submit the project so for those of you who don't know what freshman is parish council is is the second tier of government in Jamaica well cuz I'm from Jamaica of course yeah I don't know if it's the same thing in other Caribbean countries but in Jamaica the parents deals with local affairs alright so in each price you have a local government that regulates that parish so they would be the ones that you would would approve a design before you can actually go and build it all right that being said before you can do any design at all mean to consider a couple of things actually a lot of things but I'll just shorten the list to the minimum and these are some very important stuff at least things that I would require when a client comes to me and want me to do a project for them these are a couple of things that I need in order to start a design alright so the first one would be get the diagram of the property are the land you need the diagram alright that's what that's like that's a must where can you find this it is located on the surveillance reporting so this is what the surveyors report should look like in Jamaica and this is something that your client should provide you with it has the shape of the land exact precise dimensions and it tells you where the road is it tells you your neighboring properties it tells you the coordinates of property and it also gives you the north alright so this is very important because you don't want to design something that after you're done everything it cannot fit on the land is it probably too big or might be too small you could have made better use of the space that you are given alright this is actually a very good good shape has some property actually shape of triangular shape some of them looks curved all right so it's very important that you bear that in mind as you can see over this side there are some coordinates you can actually use these coordinates to draw the property in CAD to its exact dimensions because these were provided by the surveyor all right so I'll be doing a separate video on how to do that or how I go about doing the second thing no your setbacks and zoning regulations these are important you can get these from your parish council so a local da may call them up ask them what are the setbacks in say st. Anne's or what are the setbacks in climate wherever you going to design the host so for instance how far from the boundary can I build hope Oh far from the rule am I allowed to build that will help you to to make sure that your design is within the regulations all right also zoning regulations for instance how tall can you go with the house the height of your parameter world in some instance even the color of the house in Manchester you have to design your homes with attack concrete tank so that's something that I didn't know and I had to add that to our house after drying up the hose didn't know that they need a tank so I had to draw it and it was it was good 3 what are the needs of your client so you need to find that of course this is like the first thing they probably tell you hello I want a 2-bedroom house I want a three-bedroom or I want a six bedroom with Superman through a pool I want the hotel I want a bar I want a shop you know stuff like that so what do they want you find that out and then you can tell them as the project develops if their requests are possible or if they are realistic because some people add some ridiculous things and they just are not possible so yeah you gotta you as the technical guy have to educate them you know in a nice way but you have to like you know show them that okay this you cannot do that all right so yeah for a visit the site oh my god you need to visit the site you kind of get to find wrong and you don't know what a please look like unless it is a perfect and never land with nothing money but of course it is good to visit the site just to understand if there is a slope barb is an incline if there are trees if there is an existing structure somewhere if you have utility lines running across the property also if you have like like an a swamp or a river or Polly running through the property to get an understanding of this soil type if this rocky or it's clay or if it is sandy all these things are very important in order to do your design and I would say the last thing also number five just a top of the list know where North is all right so back to the surveyors report you can see the North sign indicating that the knot is in that direction that will help you to know which way the Sun Rise and where it sets so you'll be able to arrange your rooms in a way to take advantage of the movement of the Sun so for instance you wake up in the morning you look at the sunshine beautiful and then in the afternoon when you're sitting on your porch you can watch the sunset but this is not applicable in our areas you know some areas are very cluster you know like like like my poor my Kingston you know we please just cram you have to be your host that we have to turn your home that way set it that way because if you turn you can't do anything else otherwise as you know we all aspire to build our house on the top of you we can turn it off or want it or we can design it how we want it to take full advantage of the Sun okay of course there are more I'm gonna stop it right here so in this series I'll be showing you how to design at one bedroom house so all I did I just went on google and type in one bedroom house just get a simple idea and this is what I came up with it's a pretty cool pretty neat pretty simple nothing too crazy and we're gonna just work with that because what I really want to show is how to do the kind aspect of the work alright so we're going to try to model as much as we can in treaty most times I would model the the walls and windows and doors in treaty and then everything else would be in 2d but I am still learning a lot about AutoCAD and I would like to explore with you guys on the 3d aspect of Art Attack hopefully we can render at the end hopefully everything in 3d is going to take a lot of power and I'm not even sure if my laptop can handle that but if we can we will try if you can't then we'll just stick to 2d well yeah we're gonna test it out I went ahead and I had some dimensions to the sauce so yeah the bedroom would be 11 feet by 12 feet the porch would be four and a half by twelve the bathroom would be five by six kitchen nine by nine and the living and dining well the living really it would be six feet by 14 and a half and yeah the windows I just add some four feet windows standard windows and bathroom window would be two feet yeah two feet so yeah I'm just I'm just gonna use those standard windows and the walls would actually be six inch concrete block walls and you know regular strip foundation I were gonna put a little hippo roof on top of it and and and they were gonna add some details so we're gonna do the whole thing from start to finish and if you want to learn everything please stick around please subscribe and like this video if you think it is going to be a bad thank you guys for joining me thank you for watching and I'll see you in the next [Music]",
