hello everyone this is episode 13 of our
one bedroom house
and uh today what we're gonna do is to
add some columns
to our building all right but before we
get into that i want to say thank you to
all my
visionaries who have been supporting the
channel so far
um you know big open self respect and if
it's your first time on the channel
thank you for joining if you like what
you see here
or if you learned something you know
what hit the like button and also don't
forget to subscribe
and comment and everything also follow
me on my other social media platforms
instagram twitter those are the only two
i have right now
and uh yeah let's jump on the other side
let's go
[Music]
all right so you know how it goes over
here classroom style
the first question the teacher is going
to ask you is what
is a column anybody here know what is a
column raise your hand for me
you know what let's turn to google i ask
google what
is a column an upright pillar
typically cylindrical and made of stone
or concrete
supporting an entablature arch or other
structure or standing alone as a
monument
what google is basically telling us is
that a column is not
only here for pretty looks if you know
what i'm saying columns are often
load bearing which simply mean that they
are holding up
something whether it be the roof a beam
an
arch something most times or sometimes
them have it by itself standing up in
the middle of nowhere
just for pretty looks so columns also
come in various shape
size and are made from concrete stone
steel and even wood most of the columns
that are made from
wood we typically call those a post
but the their function is similar to a
column because they are
holding up something as well so we just
put them in another class there and
we'll say yeah what hold on a column so
i want to see it right listen somebody
said all right okay so before we get
into the specific columns that we're
going to use
on this building it is important to note
that the shape
size and the material that is used to
make these columns are usually
determined by
an engineer all right someone who
understands
how load works um how to do calculations
and make sure that you're using the
right steel the right
mix of concrete you know to determine if
the size of the column
is big enough or wide enough to hold up
a certain amount of
load or weight so these can be very uh
tricky if you don't understand what
you're doing but for this building
and most buildings that we do in jamaica
um we have a standard column
type that we use which i'm going to get
into in a moment
and this is just a typical example all
right so if you're going to do a much
larger building and so on
then you would need to do some more
research and find out
exactly the type of column and beam
also that would be needed for your
particular project
all right so of course the columns that
we're using will be made
from concrete they will be reinforced
with
steel or rebar and so they
look like these these are special shaped
columns
um that we in jamaica call stiffeners
right so as you can see we have various
shapes and
of course they are not limited to these
only depends on how
the walls connect all right so of course
in our drawing we will only need to use
these three top ones that you're seeing
here so the standard
t stiffener we have the eye stiffener
and we also have the l
stiffener and by just looking at it you
can basically determine where
on the building you would place these
based on the shape
of the column so of course the t would
go somewhere where the wall
meets another wall like that at a
junction
and then the eye would go on a straight
wall so if you have a wall that is very
long
or if you have a wall that stops in the
middle of a room
or something you want to use the eye
stiffener and also if you have the
corner of the building we want to use
the
l stiffness and in other cases we would
use
a cross shaped stiffener or a y shape or
a 45 degree
angle stiffener all right so you can go
ahead and download this pdf
in the description below because you're
going to need it all right as you can
see we have the dimensions on here
for this particular project and as you
can see each leg of
the stiffener has the width of the wall
so this one is six inches this one is
also six and this one over here would be
the same
as well likewise we have one that is six
by twelve
and we also have another one so if your
wall is going to be
eight inches you gonna make sure that uh
the thickness of your stiffener is also
eight
inches all right so that is that let's
move
over into autocad and we get the thing
rolling
so the first thing you want to do if you
notice here kind of go ahead with
things so that i can move a little
faster so go ahead and create
a construct and call it structural
because really actually columns and
beams would be placed
in this drawing we're not going to model
the beams
here we could do everything here in 3d
but we're going to do them in
2d just to make things easier and also
really and truly we don't need 3d for
this drawing especially due to the fact
that
these columns are basically hidden
within the walls you won't be seeing
them popping out of the wall so
we don't necessarily need to put them in
3d all right even for this
one in the corner here we already have a
column looking
thing there if i should put the drawing
in 3d you can see that we have
something that looks like a column
already so we don't need to
model anything at all here in 3d
so go ahead create a construct and we're
going to call it
structural as you can see i have it open
up already
and then you're going to minimize that
no before you minimize go ahead and
x-ref overlay the ground floor
into your structural model arm
structural drawing
so that's what i have done here so far
and then you're going to go ahead
and draw the shape of
your stiffeners so if you notice i have
one that i didn't do
which is the t-shape one so i'm going to
show you how to go about doing that
but i already have uh three
already made and these are actually
smart
as you can see they have a pull point
and they also have a rotation
uh ability so the one that i'm gonna
create i'm gonna show you how i go about
doing that so let's go ahead
and you would want to look on the pdf to
make sure that you're following
uh the dimension and the sizing
accurately
all right so we're going to turn on our
author mode and we're going to go ahead
and just draw
the t stiffness so six six
six it's all six all the way
almost like the mark of the beast circle
and sees
trample the beast all right so there we
go
so this is our thing and then we're
going to just type the command the join
we're going to join everything together
hit enter and we're going to then hatch
using the concrete uh
hatch which is this make sure that it is
saying
one do that
hit enter so now we have a hatching and
we also have
the shape of the thing all right at this
point we're gonna
turn all of this into a block so we're
gonna type
the command well let's select everything
first
and then type the command block
so what we're doing here is to as you
can see that little display there is to
turn
this object into a block now if you look
down here you can see that i have
those three made and they are named
inside of here so we're going to name
this one the
standard t
stiffener and we're going to hit
oh okay we're going to say open in block
editor because we want to
make it smart so we're gonna say okay
all right so now that we're in the
editor this is where we can make it
into something that we can rotate and
and those kind of thing so the first
thing we're gonna do is to go up to
parameter and we're gonna add
a point all right we're going to add two
points we want to be able to grab the
object from this corner and this corner
so let's do that
grab i'm going to put one point here i'm
going to put another point here
let's drag these out these are just
labels to identify where
your stuff is as you can see the blue
marker here
is where the actual thing is at and we
also want to be able to rotate
this block so we're gonna click on
rotate we want to rotate it from these
two points as well
so we're going to place the first one
right here we're going to drag this out
like so
and type it and the angle that we want
would be 180 degrees
and then we're going to also type 8 once
more
so as you can see we have our rotation
handle
right there we want to place another one
over here so we're going to click on
rotation again and we're going to click
in this corner
drag this out and type it
and our angle would be zero
enter and just like that we now have
our two rotational uh handles so
now guess what we need to make them into
actions because even though we place the
parameters
they are not active so what we're going
to do is to do the
the move handles first so let's click on
move it says here select the parameter
so we want to do this one first
so we're going to select that and then
it is now asking you what do you want to
rotate
we want to rotate everything
hit enter actually it's not rotate it's
move
let's do this the second one select the
parameter
what do you want to move everything
enter we're going to do the same thing
for rotate
so click on rotate we're going to do
this rotation parameter
first so we click on the parameter now
we need to select
everything that we want to rotate which
would be
everything hold on let me
let me let me zoom out
everything enter i'm going to do the
next one
rotate we're going to select this one
what do you want to rotate everything
enter
and that's it we hit close we hit
save and just like that
we have a block that can be moved around
with these handles let me turn this off
so we can move it around and we can also
rotate it
using any of these handles all right so
just like that you want to make sure
that you save
because that's a lot of work and also go
ahead and create
a layer for these columns so i've
already created one here
called s calls and i made it green
and also at a line weight of 0.5
mm so go ahead and create that layer and
what we're going to do is to place all
of these
on that layer so everything looks
the way it ought all right so usually
what i would do now is to start copying
these
over so we're going to hit the copy tool
i usually do this one first because this
one kind of fit in all of the corners of
the hose
all right so i'm going to place that one
there i'm going to place one here
i'm going to place one here and i'm
going to place one here
and then i'm going to place one here and
of course you're going to go ahead and
rotate them now
into the orientation if you notice this
is not good
so we need to turn on author so that we
can make them
uh perfectly straight
you don't want to rotate it and it
should be what 90 90 degree rotation and
when you check it
89.7 and that kind of thing that's
that's miss that's that that wouldn't be
good
all right you want your thing to be as
accurate as possible
so go ahead and click on those rotation
handle and
just rotate your thing
so far we have all four or five corners
taken care of
i'm gonna add a t maybe right there and
another t
over here so let's go ahead and do that
and you could actually rotate it from
here before you
copy it so that that so that way you can
just you know
move it over let me turn this off for
now
i'm gonna drop that one right there
i'm gonna need this one right here as
well turn
my author mode on before
i rotate okay obviously that was placed
in the wrong spot
so let's just drag it up like so
all right so we have two t stiffeners i
don't think we need any more than that
i'm gonna be placing a couple of um
eye stiffeners so this one i'm gonna
copy
and i'm gonna drop this one
right here and so i can
rotate this one like so
right in that spot so i would have a
beam running over this
into that and then i would have a beam
running from this
into that beam over here
i feel like i needed to have another t
stiffener right here
i don't think you need it but i'm just
gonna put it there right
so we have this beam running into that
and then this beam
running to this wall down here so what
i'll do is to put another
l right there
i'll put a l right here and
rotate this all right one other thing
you don't want to have
too many columns on the building because
you'll make the building too
rigid and that's not good you want the
building to have a some amount of wiggle
to it so that it can hold up to the
earthquakes and all of that
all right so too many columns can
actually be a problem
like if you have like tiny closets and
those things you don't need to be
putting columns in all of those areas
i think we have enough columns here and
then we might need
one extra one the square one not to be
placed right there so i'm gonna copy
this
i'm gonna drop it actually i think i've
copied it from the wrong
spot let me move it from this corner to
that corner so now we have all of our
columns in place i can go ahead and
delete these
i don't want to see them if i go to
3d you can see them on the floor and
remember that these are in
2d so and so that is how you go about
getting in your columns guys
and we're going to hit the save button
all right one of the other things that
we could actually do
is go to our views and now we need to
add these columns to our floor plan and
our
foundation plan as well so we go ahead
and right click and we say
properties i'll go down to content and
we make sure that structural is
is selected and we say okay now we're
going to do the same thing
for foundation i'm going to go to
properties content
okay it's not in our foundation and i
think i know why
the construct is on the ground floor so
i'm gonna go properties here
and i'm gonna also select foundation
okay good so that way when we go to
views and we go to foundation and we say
properties and we go to that then we
have structural as well
so that way now when we open up these
views
we now see that they're located inside
if i should open up my foundation let me
keep this
up open up foundation
we also see them inside of here and this
is very important because
these columns will be constructed from
the foundation
up and so we need to be able to see them
from this view as well all right guys so
that is where we're gonna wrap this up
today
um thank you for watching thank you for
tuning in i hope that you learned
