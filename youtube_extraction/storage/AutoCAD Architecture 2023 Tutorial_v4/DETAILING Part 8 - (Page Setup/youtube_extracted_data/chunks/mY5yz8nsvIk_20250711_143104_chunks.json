In today's video I'll be showing you how to get your\nsheets all set up in AutoCAD and how to print them in PDF format. So you might hear terminologies like\nsheet template, field text, sheet set, subsets or sheet properties, stuff like that but don't worry,\nI'm sure by the end of this episode you'll understand what all of that means.\nNow this video is going to be a long one so buckle up.",
