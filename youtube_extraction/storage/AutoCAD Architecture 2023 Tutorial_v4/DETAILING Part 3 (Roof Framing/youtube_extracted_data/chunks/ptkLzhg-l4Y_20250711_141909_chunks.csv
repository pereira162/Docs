at the roof-threaming plant for this one bedroom host that we have been drawing for the
longest while now. Anyways, if it's a first time on the channel,
thank you for joining us, I hope that after watching this video you will learn something
which would also prompt you to hit that subscribe button hit the like or hit the share.
All you gotta do is just do one of those things and if you missed the previous episodes coming up
to this point then everything in is in the description the link everything."
1,"ious episodes coming up
to this point then everything in is in the description the link everything. So without further
do let's get into the roof-threaming plant drawing. Alright guys, so here we are back in
AutoClim architecture and we're gonna just get straight into it. So as you can see I currently have
the roof-threaming plant view open up because we're gonna be working inside of this drawing today.
This drawing was created back in episode 12 when we had created our views from the project
Navigator so make sure you go back and watch that one if you missed it."
2,"our views from the project
Navigator so make sure you go back and watch that one if you missed it. Alright that's all we got
to this point. Now it's important to note that a roof-threaming plant is different from a roof plan.
Alright I have a illustration here in Google Sketchup so it's a similar roof to what we have over
there for the one bedroom house and as you can see this is what a roof plan would look like with just
the overall layout and shape of the roof and you can have additional details and annotations on this
such as the arrows showing the direction of flow."
3,"n have additional details and annotations on this
such as the arrows showing the direction of flow. We could also have the you know labeling telling us
where the roof gotter is and also like the material that we're gonna use on the roof.
Things like those. Alright but the roof-threaming plant shows us more of what is underneath
this layer right here which would be what we're seeing here. Alright and so this drawing is very
important because it shows us the skeleton underneath the flesh."
4,"lright and so this drawing is very
important because it shows us the skeleton underneath the flesh. Yeah understand we're seeing all
this structural elements that actually hold up the roof and so producing a drawing like this will
be important for the carpenter to have so that he can know our she where each raster should be at
you know the spacing between each of them what size rafters are they and just a general layout
of the structural elements beneath the roof covering."
5,"ze rafters are they and just a general layout
of the structural elements beneath the roof covering. Alright guys so this is what we want to
produce something similar to this not exactly like this but you know similar to this in article
architecture now the problem with article is that just like with this eye was able to create a 3D
representation in Google Sketchup in article it's actually more difficult to do."
6,"ble to create a 3D
representation in Google Sketchup in article it's actually more difficult to do. So it's easier especially
for a simple roof like this to just do it in a 2 dimensional setting so even though we have this
building as a 3D building we're gonna be doing this roof framing plant as a 2 dimensional drawing
so that is what we're gonna be doing here."
