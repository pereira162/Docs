Anyways, if it's a first time on the channel,\nthank you for joining us, I hope that after watching this video you will learn something\nwhich would also prompt you to hit that subscribe button hit the like or hit the share.\nAll you gotta do is just do one of those things and if you missed the previous episodes coming up\nto this point then everything in is in the description the link everything.",

Alright guys, so here we are back in\nAutoClim architecture and we're gonna just get straight into it. So as you can see I currently have\nthe roof-threaming plant view open up because we're gonna be working inside of this drawing today.\nThis drawing was created back in episode 12 when we had created our views from the project\nNavigator so make sure you go back and watch that one if you missed it.",
