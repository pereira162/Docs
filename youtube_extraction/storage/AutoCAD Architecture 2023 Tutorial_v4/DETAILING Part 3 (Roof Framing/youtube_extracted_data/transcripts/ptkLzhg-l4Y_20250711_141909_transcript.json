  "full_text": "Hi everybody, thank you for joining me on today's episode we're gonna be looking at the roof-threaming plant for this one bedroom host that we have been drawing for the longest while now. Anyways, if it's a first time on the channel, thank you for joining us, I hope that after watching this video you will learn something which would also prompt you to hit that subscribe button hit the like or hit the share. All you gotta do is just do one of those things and if you missed the previous episodes coming up to this point then everything in is in the description the link everything. So without further do let's get into the roof-threaming plant drawing. Alright guys, so here we are back in AutoClim architecture and we're gonna just get straight into it. So as you can see I currently have the roof-threaming plant view open up because we're gonna be working inside of this drawing today. This drawing was created back in episode 12 when we had created our views from the project Navigator so make sure you go back and watch that one if you missed it. Alright that's all we got to this point. Now it's important to note that a roof-threaming plant is different from a roof plan. Alright I have a illustration here in Google Sketchup so it's a similar roof to what we have over there for the one bedroom house and as you can see this is what a roof plan would look like with just the overall layout and shape of the roof and you can have additional details and annotations on this such as the arrows showing the direction of flow. We could also have the you know labeling telling us where the roof gotter is and also like the material that we're gonna use on the roof. Things like those. Alright but the roof-threaming plant shows us more of what is underneath this layer right here which would be what we're seeing here. Alright and so this drawing is very important because it shows us the skeleton underneath the flesh. Yeah understand we're seeing all this structural elements that actually hold up the roof and so producing a drawing like this will be important for the carpenter to have so that he can know our she where each raster should be at you know the spacing between each of them what size rafters are they and just a general layout of the structural elements beneath the roof covering. Alright guys so this is what we want to produce something similar to this not exactly like this but you know similar to this in article architecture now the problem with article is that just like with this eye was able to create a 3D representation in Google Sketchup in article it's actually more difficult to do. So it's easier especially for a simple roof like this to just do it in a 2 dimensional setting so even though we have this building as a 3D building we're gonna be doing this roof framing plant as a 2 dimensional drawing so that is what we're gonna be doing here. Now the first thing we want to do right now is to get rid of the things that we don't want to see such as windows doors and openings of course I already turn off the space layer right space that's off but I'm not gonna actually turn off these ones what I'm gonna do is to raise the cutting plane here it is down here 3 feet 6 we're gonna raise it to 9 feet which would be above everything when we go back to our plan view we shouldn't be seeing anything alright so let's do that open it up now we're gonna change it to 9 feet but we also want to change this number also to 9 feet and the reason being is that currently it is at minus 10 which means that everything that goes all the way down to negative 10 feet we'll still be able to see some representation of those objects we don't want to see anything below 9 feet so it's gonna be another 9 feet right there we're gonna hit okay just like that everything disappears even though there are still there but we don't want to see them alright the next thing I'm gonna advise you to do is to change your scale to the scale that you want to do this drawing at and this is very important because it does affect the line type and the hatching even though we're not gonna be using any hatching in this demonstration today alright so the next thing I want to do is to flatten this 3D drawing because currently this is a 3D object I want to flatten it so that we have just a 2D drawing I'm sure there are many ways we can do this but the easiest way that I have found is to just go to or section elevation drop down here and go to hidden line projection once we click on this button all we need to do is to select all the objects we want to be in this projection so we highlight everything and then we're gonna hit enter and then all we need to do is to place it where we want it so I'm gonna place it like maybe like right here and I'm gonna hit enter and just like this we have this drawing it looks very similar to this one what the difference is if I should go into 2D or 3D rather we can see that this is a flat drawing while this remains a 3D drawing so now we have this over here to work with alright and the beautiful thing about this tool here is that you can you can use it to do anything if you want an isometric projection just set the drawing in isometric use the tool and place it and once you go back to your top view you're gonna have that isometric drawing over here alright so try to experiment with it alright so note that we have this 2D drawing let's explore it alright because we want to be able to manipulate each line by themselves and the problem with this now is that when we explore these lines become broken apart as well and it's kind of hard to go through and select them all so what we're gonna do is to right click and say select similar so what happened the problem knows that it has selected the walls and I kind of want to keep the walls as well so now we're gonna have to try another solution let's try to select everything that is on this particular color okay how do we do that though we have a command that is called smart select quick select not smart we don't want to do it to the entire drawing we're gonna select the region that we want this operation to take place so only in this region and we're gonna hit enter and then what kind of objects we want to select some lines and we want to use the color of the line and then we want the color to be this color right here alright because that's the color we want to get rid of and then we're gonna say okay and then just like that we have selected all of those lines on that particular color boom delete it gone so far so good I want to just kind of clean up this little error here so if you notice we kind of want to see the walls beneath the roof that's important because the carpenter will need to know which wall is located at what area of the roof and which wall is supporting the roof and of a general idea where each room is located so you want to have the rooms the problem with this is that the walls are in solid lines while the roof is in hidden and what kind of wanted to be the opposite alright we want the roof to be solid and we want the walls to be hidden so I have already gone ahead and created two layers so I have a roof framing layer I have it in orange and it's continuous with a 0.5 line width and the wall I actually change it to hidden and at a 0.2 line width let me mix this off the reason why you're not seeing in the changes here is because these lines are not using the what we call by layer option alright so that's something we need to fix so we're gonna select all of these select similar we're going to put them on the roof framing plan and we're gonna change the color to be by layer and also gonna change a line type to be by layer we're gonna do the same thing with the walls select similar and we're gonna say by layer line type by layer line width also by layer I don't think I had changed these guys to by layer for the line type so let's check that again yep so this should be by layer and and if you notice by changing everything to by layer you notice what happened on another roof is in focus while the walls are in background from here we can go ahead and start to add our roof framing elements so all your rafters all your fascia board and all of that I like to begin with the fascia board because I think for this particular project that's the easiest place to begin so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna switch over to the roof framing layer and then draw a box over this and then I'm gonna offset one inch because we know that the the fascia board is one inch by 10 enter and then I'm gonna offset this inward all right do not put it on the outside put it on the inside all right so that would represent my fascia board right here all right and then the next step would be to start under ridge and then I work my way out but I find that the easiest way to do this is to use the box tool so I'm gonna draw a box which measures two inches by two inches and it looks stupid but check this out I'm gonna copy this box and I'm gonna place it right here all right I'm gonna just drag this now out to this end and just like that I already have my ridge board now guys if you're unfamiliar with the parts of the roof it's important that you'll learn the different parts of the roof such as the gavel he valley and things like those you also need to be familiar with the different names for the rafters as well so make sure to google that and learn what you need to learn so I'm gonna stretch this out just another inch so that the corners line up with these lines here and then the next thing I'm gonna do is to copy this our let me copy this box again because we're gonna be copying this box quite a bit control shift c so I can paste it multiple times so I'm gonna rotate this box for the valley greas so that it turns this way and then I can turn off our thermode and I'll pull this down all the way to this point here so now I have my hip raf the look at that control via again to paste I want this one to be move right on the edge of that and I'm gonna stretch this out turn on the arthomode all the way to the edge of this fascia board right here all right so so far so good and then I'm gonna just rotate this from the center here using the copy tool and I'm rotated 90 degrees so what we did there was to rotate this to get a duplicate around this side all right so these are kind of how you want to start to layout your roof and a simple roof like this makes it even easier because once we do one side we can mirror it to get the other side so we have that let's go ahead and copy this common rafter and we're gonna copy out to get our other rafter which would be 24 inches apart so that's the maximum you want to be at all right and then I'm gonna stop right here because I'm gonna flip this on this side I'm gonna just keep going down into inside of here so let's just copy these I'm gonna use a reference point to copy those so I can move quickly all right so now I have all of these rafters going down obviously these ones need to be shortened to line up on this hip rafter so what I'm gonna do here is to just bring these points down and this is the beautiful thing about using the box art erect angle tool I can simply just manipulate the box to get the shape that I need and it works perfectly guys you know don't know away with the offset offset business you know and I'm sure there's a easier way to do this tool you know but I find this to be quite easy to do it that way because no everything is like an object by themselves all right one of the things I want to do as well is to edit this rafter so that it stops in this corner on both ends so I'm gonna put our extra vertex in the middle there can see that and then I'm gonna bring it this center all the way down to here and then bring these corners down to there we use it x that green x just like that and then we're gonna do the same thing down here where we're gonna add vertex gonna place the vertex right where we need it and then we're gonna move these two end oops that's wrong move these two ends up to where you see the green x which would mean intersection good so though that rafter looks beautiful right in that corner there and then all we need to do now is to mirror so what we're gonna do here is to mirror all of these rafters including the hip rafter over onto this side so let's use the mirror tool and we're gonna find the center of this line where you see that triangle midpoint and then we're gonna just drag it but we need to turn on the arthamode so that we get a straight line down so we're gonna click I'm gonna hit enter so just like that now we have one side completed now if you notice each of these are currently at a two feet center to center but in the middle here we have a slide issue this one is a little bit smaller than what is required to get a two feet distance so because it is smaller what we're gonna do is to just copy this one now we're gonna just place it in the dead center which means that this portion would be a tad bit smaller than the two feet but that's okay because you want them to be a maximum two feet but it can also be less all right so bear that in mind all right so once we get that what I'm gonna do now is to do some more mirror so I'm gonna actually mirror these guys to fill this gap right here how you do that all right try to so at mirror and this time we're gonna use this 45 degree center line as our mirror line so we're gonna click in the center there drag it down to this corner and just like that we're gonna hit enter and now we have the next one it's and so again we're gonna just mirror these guys all of these over to this side so let's do that mirror just like we did earlier from that green triangle click enter and look at that we have half of the roof done and then I'm gonna just do the same thing again that all right so I don't need these two because these are already on the center line I don't want to mirror those so I'm gonna mirror what we have here I'm gonna mirror from this center here to this center here and look at that we have a finished roof framing plan delete that all right and so this is looking wonder loss beauty full so what I'm gonna do actually there's a tool that I discovered I have never really used it much in the past but I'm using it now we're gonna select everything I were gonna just group I don't know how I didn't think about it's before but when you group objects it's not really a block because usually when you create a block and you select the block you would see the name change here to blocks but Otaka is telling us that we have selected 54 polylines which mean we can still treat this as if it were a polyline we can convert it you know that's a nice tool to just group your elements together that way you know mistakenly do something stupid so I'm gonna do the same thing with the walls select all and I'm gonna just GR or UP and you can also ungroup it by just typing ungroup all right so the walls are grouped the roof is grouped and so now we're gonna add some details to this drawing one of the first ones I usually like to add is the rafter labels and this is how I usually do it I know they're a lot of different ways to do this but this is how I usually go about doing it first of all I am on the wrong layer all right so I'm gonna go back to zero I'm currently using the zero layer as my notes layer to add notes so here that in mind you might want to create a separate layer for that all right so I usually create this big dot and place it right in the middle here and I'm gonna copy it two times over to this rafter and then this rafter I'm gonna move it down a little bit then I'm gonna draw a line through the middle then I'm gonna group them all right so this is how I usually do this and then I would add a note on here that says all right so this note has a lot of stuff inside of it is telling us the size of the material they are treatment of the material on the type of wood common jack rafter so it's telling us that these this is applied to both the common rafters which are the full length rafters as well as the jack rafters which are the ones that are cut at an angle and then these are mainly two feet center to center and we use a term mainly because of course we know that we have one in the middle here are two that is not equally spaced at the two feet so we use that term right here all right and so of course I'm gonna pull this out so that it can look a little bit nicer all right so something like that and of course we're gonna mirror this on the other side I'm gonna be using the mirror to a quiet often in this video guys so just like that that is done and I'm gonna mirror this as well this one up here on the 45 so I can get it on the right there and I'm gonna mirror this again to get it in the middle not in the middle on the other side so now I have on all four sides and then I'm gonna just copy this over if it turned that off and then trying to get it straight all right good of course I probably should have mirror this as well so far we have all our common and jack rafters labeled no we can go ahead and add rather copy this because most of the rafters are the same size of course in different scenarios you'll have different size rafters so you need to pay attention to that I think we'll make this two by eight which would mean that this would be 200 WPP hip rafter all right so the hip rafter is just a tad bit bigger and that's all you'd have for the hip rafter there's no center to center and that kind of thing because it's you know it's just one on that side and of course we're gonna mirror this all over the place mirror mirror good and then we have one ridge board in the middle here so I'm gonna just probably just I'm gonna just copy this and I'm gonna say 2 by 10 I think 10 would be 250 ridge board and of course I'm gonna move the ira over I'm gonna actually move this over a tad bit good all right so that's the ridge board and then finally we just want to add one last label to capture the the fish aboard and this would be a one by 10 which would mean 25 by 250 fish board period all right and of course you know how the drill go already I mean sometimes you don't even have to put them all around you could just you know give a general label and say tip which is the shining for a tip because but you know I'm just going all out for this and I'm not even gonna put any at the top there I'm just leaving it right there and then finally we can't leave off our arrows that will show the direction of flow so I do have this arrow that is in the design center control tool that will bring this up and of course you can follow my direction here I think it's located in the same spot for all auto cuts off where so dynamic blocks and in this thing here you have a little arrow that I use quite often so I'm gonna bring it in X this off and so here it is I'm gonna have to just use this skill but the skill drawing thing here all right so I'm a skill it don't like this I've tried let me rotate it first 90 degrees and I'm gonna move it and place it roughly about both here maybe yeah right here yeah it is a good spot and you know the jewel already I'm gonna just mirror the arrows still a little bit big but you know you can adjust your is to make it look nicer mirror have it on that side and then I'm gonna mirror again mirror again and then I'm gonna mirror again so now we have arrows showing us the direction of flow these arrows are really big and ugly but it is what it is and so now what is left for us to do we're gonna add some detail section because remember if we go back to our detail views down here we did have a detail for Eve as well as Ridge all right so what we want to do is to show those detailed collotes on this drawing as well so we're gonna go to annotate and we're gonna go to collotes and we're gonna select this particular one that tells us the drawing number as well as the sheet number okay and this one has the tail on it I like the one on the tail so I'm gonna place it actually I'm gonna place it down here drag this and click hit enter and then you can tell it which direction you want to turn I'm gonna turn it up and click and then we do not want to create any drawing we're gonna just say collote only and later on we will be filling in these fields with the appropriate information we're gonna do one in the middle here as well for the ridge so go ahead again and click on that and let's just draw one here and hit enter and then I'm gonna turn it this direction and I must say collote only all right and the same thing applies here okay so these are the only two details we're gonna be having if you had a valley then you and you have a valley detail of course you'd want to do one or as well as other parts of the roof if you had additional details you could add as much detail collotes as you need all right but this is all we need for this particular drawing we're not gonna add anything else the only thing we're gonna do now is to just create our view and you already know the shrubs roof, framing plan all right I'm gonna select our region which would be something like that now we're gonna hit okay and of course we can go ahead and add our title and the title would be something like that with the roof framing plan for some reason these things are not filling in but I believe it there so this is what we have for our roof framing plan okay guys and this is all you really need to scrape true at parish console of course we do have our additional details such as the ev detail and the ridge detail that we're gonna be flesh and old in another video as well as all of these other little things right here all right so don't worry about that we're gonna get there but for now this is where we're gonna stop this video that you learn something I'm gonna drop this particular sheet drawing in a PDF so that you can download it in the links below all right so definitely check the description below for that all right guys we're gonna add one last thing and here that I almost forget that we could also put the slope of the roof on here and we can represent that by simply drawing a triangle and basically we want to have something looking like a right animal triangle some like that this is the slope symbol and we're gonna write underneath that what slope it is now this roof is at a 30 degree slope which if you're wearing it out to be represented in the roof slope standard it would be 6.9 for to 12 of course we could run this after 7 but if we do that mean the roof would be a little bit over the 30 degrees slope which we already have modeled all right so we don't want to change that all right so we're gonna put this like one here and we could actually put another note and I need to here to say tip for all slopes all right I mean if you had different slopes then of course you want to put a triangle wherever that different slope is all right but since we only have one angle we use across the entire roof we'll just put something like that over there and that should be good to go all right so yeah that's it my god that was a long video cheese anyways thank you for watching the
