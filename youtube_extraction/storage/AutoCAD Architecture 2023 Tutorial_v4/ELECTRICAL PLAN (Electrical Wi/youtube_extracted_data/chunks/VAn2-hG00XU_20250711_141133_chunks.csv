what we're going to do is an electrical plan so you see we are get plant-tubber things
we are moving with the project alright so don't move on muscle
If you're new here we've been doing a one bedroom house from scratch and we're
trying to produce all the drawings that are necessary for a proof-all we are
going to produce views and we're going to also put them on sheets and we're going to print
them and we're goi"
1,"produce views and we're going to also put them on sheets and we're going to print
them and we're going to maybe I'll submit it what do you think about that I could
actually do a video on all of that but we'll see we'll see if you want me to do it
just comment it down below or hit the like button we see we see what that goes

where you're from but I do hope that you learn something nonetheless and that you

things also if you've never seen an electrical plan it would be a good idea to see
what one looks like so you could just go on Google type in electrical plans and
just look at some images and you will notice that you have a flow plan with you

know some symbols all over the place representing different things and you
might see like things connecting to other things and so on and so forth try to
understand what is happening on an electrical plan read all the notes on the
side of the page and also get familiar with the different symbols that I
represented on an electrical plan alright that's very very important all right
so here I have provided a PDF with a list of symbols or rather electrical

5,"e I have provided a PDF with a list of symbols or rather electrical
symbols that we're going to be using on this electrical plan and of course this
list is very limited in comparison to the amount of symbols that are available
to use now for this little one bedroom house we don't need a lot of stuff in
fact this list is probably too much because I'm definitely not going to be
placing all of these symbols or components within this little tiny bedroom
house alright so of course you can download th"

house alright so of course you can download this PDF in the link in the
description make sure that you get yourself familiar with the different symbols
for instance this one represents shandelier you have emergency light unit this
one represents switches and I wanted to kind of explain this one a little bit so
I regular switch would look like this that's like the light switch which would
mean single pole switch alright no if you have a double"
7,"his that's like the light switch which would
mean single pole switch alright no if you have a double pole toggle switch then you
would put a tool where the X is if you have a three-way toggle switch you would
put a three there if you have a dimmer switch you'd put a t there alright so
these can become important as you do your drawing depending on what your
project requires likewise when you go up to outlets or electrical plugs when
you have a regular outlet it's normal but when you add a subscri"
8,"to outlets or electrical plugs when
you have a regular outlet it's normal but when you add a subscript to it then it
means that that subscript represent whatever is over here alright so far
instance a grown fall circuit interrupta this one would be placed in like a
kitchen or in the bathroom where there might be water getting in contact
with electrical equipment like a hair dryer or your blender stuff like that you
have water proof as well these are mostly used outdoors so all of these abbreviat"
9,"tuff like that you
have water proof as well these are mostly used outdoors so all of these abbreviations
would go underneath the plug to represent respectively and then you have other
symbols like USB outlet television outlet you have panels you have even
security cameras alright so a nice little list here that we can use on a wide
array of projects so go ahead don't know them if you don't have your symbols
make sure that you draw them in auto cut so that you'll have them to use of
course I'm go"
10,"ur symbols
make sure that you draw them in auto cut so that you'll have them to use of
course I'm gonna go bring to auto cut now where I actually have these symbols
ready and waiting to go so of course I have made them into blocks I'm gonna
be using them in our project so that's this drawing I'm gonna actually go into
the one bedroom house project now alright so let's do that so we're gonna go

11,"r to our project navigate and this is where all of our drawing exists we have
our construct we have our views we have already created some views but we had
a couple more constructs that we needed to create such as the electrical construct
so we're gonna be doing that no so what we're gonna do is to right click on
here I'm gonna go down to new and we're gonna see construct and we're gonna call
this electric call layout now if you had multiple levels for instance if you have

12,"electric call layout now if you had multiple levels for instance if you have
ground floor second floor third floor then you would need to have an
electrical layout for each level alright so you would have probably level one
here and then you'd create another construct and call it level two because each
level would have a different layout alright and then we're gonna select the
level that would we're gonna be applying this too so it's gonna be the ground
level because this is just a single floor"
13,"'re gonna be applying this too so it's gonna be the ground
level because this is just a single floor building I'm gonna open the drawing so
let's click okay and as you can see that we have the construct over here
being created and then we are also inside of that drawing electrical layout
alright moving on from this it's a blank drawing so obviously we need to get
the floor planning set of here how do we do that we go to our ground floor
construct and we're gonna right click and see X-RF overly a"
14,"do we do that we go to our ground floor
construct and we're gonna right click and see X-RF overly alright now we have our
floor plan in the drawing what we need now also is our fixtures alright so
we're gonna right click overly now we can see where everything is so we can
properly layout our electrical devices okay so I'm gonna minimize this because I
don't need that anymore and then I'm going to actually turn off a couple of
these layers because I don't want to see them so I'm gonna click on t"
15,"actually turn off a couple of
these layers because I don't want to see them so I'm gonna click on this little
guy here called freeze I'm gonna freeze that and I'm gonna also freeze this and I
think I will keep everything else for now alright so let's leave it there the
next thing we're gonna do is to create some layers alright so if you don't know
where your layer property is it's right here click on that guy and it should

16,"k on that guy and it should
bring up alright so here's my layer property and I'm gonna actually create some
layers so I'm gonna call this new layer E light made that green of course you can
choose your own color let's not a hard rule right there gonna call this one E power
and I'm gonna explain to you why I'm giving why I'm creating these layers and
why do I call it what it is I'm gonna create another one call it E data by the
way the east stands for Electrical alright and I'm gonna make this ma"

way the east stands for Electrical alright and I'm gonna make this magenta line
with this point zero nine the number gonna create one last one I'm gonna call it E

continuous I'm gonna make it dashed alright so why do I create these layers
basically what I want to do is to put all lighting fixtures or lighting devices

on the lighting layer all power devices such as the outlets and the panel boxes I
want to put those on the power layer everything that has to do with data this
was built incorrectly such as like you know internet digital cable and wireless
Verizon all of those guys would go on this layer and then wire basically anything
that is being connected by wire I will use this layer to connect them alright so
that's it so let's go over now so what I want to do is to get our blocks"
19,"to connect them alright so
that's it so let's go over now so what I want to do is to get our blocks over here
into our electrical draw what do you think is the easiest way to do it of course
the easiest way would be to just copy the whole thing and bring it over but
what if I told you that there was a more efficient and effective way to do it
and in order for this to work what you have to do is to make sure that you have
all of your blocks in one drawing okay and if you notice my blocks are name"
20,"make sure that you have
all of your blocks in one drawing okay and if you notice my blocks are named
properly if you click on any one of these blocks they're properly named so make
sure you name them and you give them a base point so anyone I'm a blocks that you
click on you will see that I have a base point on them once you have them all in
one drawing you save that drawing save it go over to your electrical plan and we're
going to open the blocks palette so type in command blocks palette here"
21,"ur electrical plan and we're
going to open the blocks palette so type in command blocks palette here it is
click on it and it will bring up your blocks palette and here as you can see we
have three tabs on the left here we have current drawing showing all the blocks
that are available in this current drawing we have a recent which is showing you
whatever you have used recently and other drawings now if you notice I already
have these loaded in but if you didn't have anything here what you would"
22,"ow if you notice I already
have these loaded in but if you didn't have anything here what you would do is to
click on the three dots and find your drawing that has all the blocks inside of it
which would be this guy over here you'd then go ahead and press open but of
course I would have already loaded it in so it is in and actually I made some
settings changes down here which I will be explaining in a couple of seconds the
good thing now is that we can use all the blocks from this drawing inside"
23,"in a couple of seconds the
good thing now is that we can use all the blocks from this drawing inside of
this drawing and the beautiful thing about that is let's say I drew this one
incorrectly but guess what I would have already placed it all over in this
drawing instead of deleting all of them and redoing it what I would do is to go
over to this drawing make the change to that block right here save it and it would
automatically updates in this drawing so that's a beautiful thing about doing it"
24,"ve it and it would
automatically updates in this drawing so that's a beautiful thing about doing it
this way now if you notice down here I changed the scale I made it uniform and I
set it to 25 because initially it was at one and if I were to place a
a block on one then you notice it was very small so you have to increase the scale
to a comfortable number I use 25 you know that will look somewhat reasonable on
your drawing so as you can see now that looks good and then I select rotation
because"
25,"reasonable on
your drawing so as you can see now that looks good and then I select rotation
because when I placed a block I want to have the ability to rotate it and then
I also have repeat placement which means that when I place one outlet I can go
ahead and keep placing the others I don't have to come back to this panel here
and so on and so forth so that's what we really want to do here all right now
before we place anything I'm going to actually select the layer that I'm going to
work with f"
26,"ht now
before we place anything I'm going to actually select the layer that I'm going to
work with first so first we're going to be placing our power devices which
would include outlets and panel boxes so the first thing I'm going to
place is a panel box which is this guy here I'm going to use a flush one so that
means this one will be flushing with the wall and it's a too far to volt for
most households in Jamaica we don't use more than 240 and I'm going to place my
panel right here in the kitc"
27,"seholds in Jamaica we don't use more than 240 and I'm going to place my
panel right here in the kitchen it's not the best location guys I know but for a
host like this where I don't even have much space that's probably one of the
best places to put it you don't want to put it we're going to have high
traffic and you don't want to put it where kids and so on can grab it but in this
case this is just a one bedroom house and I would assume that most adults would
be using this one bedroom house agai"
28,"t a one bedroom house and I would assume that most adults would
be using this one bedroom house again it'll depend on the purpose of the
building all right the next thing we're going to place our son doplex outlet and
doplex is the regular plug that you see on your wall every day okay guys so
we're going to drop some doplex let's start in the bedroom you know you have to
place one beside the bed cause guess what if you don't you know the phone now

29,"ause guess what if you don't you know the phone now
go get charged so that's that we're going to place one underneath the the computer
desk and if you notice I kind of place it in the middle of the wall or in the
middle of the window like wise for that one it does always have to be like that you
know so up to you now if you notice I can rotate when I place and that is why we
select the rotation option down here we notice I I want to make it straight
down I can turn on the art mode to get that fu"
