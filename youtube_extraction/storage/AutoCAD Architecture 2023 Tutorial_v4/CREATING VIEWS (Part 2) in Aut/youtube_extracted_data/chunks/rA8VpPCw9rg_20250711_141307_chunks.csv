get some deeper understanding of how to use the views manager inside of the views tab.
Alright so in the previous episode I think it was episode 12 that's where we went through and
would have created all of these views you're looking at here so we do have a 3D view which is the
one I currently have open and we also have you know all the other v"
1,"e do have a 3D view which is the
one I currently have open and we also have you know all the other views that we will need
including some sectional elevations and a couple of details and so on and so forth so all we need
our a couple of other details to wrap up our views and then we can start to add details to these views
such as dimensions and attations and that kind of stuff and then after that's done we would add them to
or sheets where it would then be printed."

or sheets where it would then be printed. Alright the views we'll be adding are detailed views okay
we do have 3 details so far as you can see don't here we do have a Eve detail we have foundation
footing detail and we also have the ridge detail and if I should open this drawing up you can see that we have

all three views right here. Alright and these were taken from our sectional elevation views so
if I open this guy up you can see that we have three collotes we do have the Eve footing and the
ridge and calling these out with their bubbles they shop in this drawing because this is where we
place them and as we place these views on sheets these are fields here will be populated with numbers
and also these will become populated with the sheet number and the drawing number itself."
