  "full_text": "all right welcome everyone today is all about tool palettes real quick those of you who are first timers here or those of you who have not seen or heard me before i've got over 36 years of experience in autocad across multiple industry segments i'm currently one of our senior support specialists here in our technical support group so if you have a contract with us and you call in for support there's a good chance you can get me i've taught autocad as a certified instructor as a matter of fact i'm teaching civil 3d next week for four days i've got more than 15 years in cad management eight years in cruise ship building five years supporting civil survey and landscape architecture i've pretty much run the gamut the only thing i haven't really done is aerospace and automotive engineering or drafting and i have a bachelor's in business management and master's in organizational management so today's agenda we're going to cover what is a tool palette what you can put in a tool palette customizing and creating tool palettes how you share tool palettes to single users multi-users to a common location this is a common one we run across and i've got some bonus items at the end here that we're going to talk about so let's get right into this so what is the tool palette tool palette is used to organize tools that range from blocks to commands hatch patterns pretty much anything um and are displayed as part of the tool palettes window you can customize tool palettes by dragging and dropping files from windows explorer file explorer objects from a drawing area contextual menus of a tool palette window customize your cui your customizable user interface editor or the customize dialog box each tool palette that is created represents a tab on the tool palettes window the default folder to store tool palettes is percent app data percent that takes you to c colon backslash users backslash your username backslash appdata backslash roaming so rather than type all that out you could just put percent outdated percent it'll take you right to the roaming folder under autodesk your product name your release your language and then support tool palettes to power palettes i'll show you where this location is right so if we drag this over here i can come here i can go percent app data percent i go to my autodesk folder and you'll see here's all the stuff i have installed we'll go autocad 2023 here's my r version here's enu for language and if we come to support and here is my tool palette location so there's my tool palette and here's where the individual palettes are located just want to make sure you guys knew that so what can you put into a tool palette well pretty much anything you can put autocad commands you can put blocks and you're not actually putting a block in there you're putting a pointer to a block so it's a quick way of holding on to your standards and or common things you use most often you can put list proteins in there in other words if you have customized list routines you can put those commands in there you can put hatch patterns materials and just about anything you can use in autocad you can put in there you can put just about anything so when we get around to this now we're going to talk about customizing and creating tool palettes so to bring up the tool palette you type in tool palettes in the command line you navigate to the view tab and select tool palettes from the palettes area or you hold down the ctrl key and hit the number three that'll bring up your tool pallets it comes pre-populated with some typical information that you may or may not use or need you're going to find a lot of stuff in here generally speaking everything that comes across in here especially when you're dealing with things like this one which happens to be the annotation tab this one is all national cad standards sized so if you guys use national cad standards you'll see that these are actually national cad standards sized correctly um and then to create a new tool palette you right mouse click on the title bar on the side so you right mouse click over here and you say new new palette it'll open up a palette here and it'll give you a name given the palette something you can come back to easily so name it something you can remember and then you add the items commands content as you see fit now to create custom palette group so when we're talking about palette groups is that you can have individual palettes and then you can group those palettes into a palette group so you can only if you have depending on which group you have active you will only see the palettes contained in that group and not every palette so you can come over here and create a new palette group in the customized palettes you right mouse click in palette groups here somewhere and you select new group and drag the group so it will be a separate group so it's not under an existing group and apparently i need to put a end parenthesis at the end of that i'll make sure i do that before i send this pdf out to laurie if you want copies of the slides and then you drag palettes from the left under the new group you just created it's all very straightforward and simple and then once you have the items in here you can access additional features by right mouse clicking on the items in the tool palette and selecting properties what i mean by that is you can change your name your description you can change where the source file is you've got scale so in other words it's going to insert a scale of one auxiliary scale if you are old school and you use dim scale or you use lt scale or some of the other scales you can use the auxiliary scale to scale this information correctly you can automatically add a rotation value here or you can turn on the prompt for a rotation if you want to explode the block on insert you can change that box here color is going to be by layer layers use current line type is use current plot style you can actually change this information so if you want trees to always come on an a-tree layer or a c tree layer or something like that you can specify that layer as long as it's in the drawing when you create the tool palette you can set that layer and whatever layer properties this has if that layer does not exist in your drawing when you insert this block it'll automatically create that layer and put the block on it there are some other things so for example this tree here is a dynamic block we know that from the little lightning bolt and you'll see that you can actually change which view you have of the dynamic block down here when you insert it this is what it's going to insert so it'll insert the view is palm plan if i select this it'll come in as palm in the plan view so now let's do a quick little demonstration we're going to go through everything that i just talked about so here i am in autocad again i'm just going to come up here here's my view tab and here is where i can turn on my tool palettes right here and you're going to see that i have just common tool palettes here so first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to right mouse click here and i'm going to say new palette and i'm going to call this webinar so this is going to be our webinar palette now here's some fun things right so i can come over here and since i have some information in here i can do some very easy things from here i can come into webinar so here's my block palette standards i can come over here to pipe and i can just click and drag these pieces in here one at a time i could do some group of items drag them all in here okay piece of cake and i can also do things like i can right mouse click here you'll see i can add a separator so i've got a little separator bar in here i can do things like i can add a piece of text and i can say let's go eight inch pipe so what i'm holding on to here is i can actually come in here and i can set this differently so i can if i have blocks built with imperial measurement with eight inch text height how can i use these blocks with metrics drawing without affecting on the text height all right so that's a more convoluted question and it's more about blocks so if you have blocks built with imperial david yes we can load a lisp through there i'll show you that in just a minute so if i have blocks with imperial measurement of 8 inch text height how can i use these blocks with metric drawing without effecting on the text height that's going to depend on how you are inserting them if you're inserting them from here they're going to utilize the insertion units and it's going to scale it up or down depending on that i have another webinar where i talked about units insertion units and things like that if you have your unit set correctly it'll either scale the block but it will right so if we go to our properties here right you can scale them here and i have dim scale none in plot scale for auxiliary scale but you can't leave your text height at eight inches without altering the entire block okay that's the important thing to know essen is that when you insert the block from the block palette it's no different than using the or when you're using a tool palette it's no different than using the block palette or using the classic insert um when you bring it across it is going to scale it up or down based on the drawings insertion units um so if you need to leave it at eight inch text height that's going to be a different conversation we need to have okay so getting back to david is it possible to load a lisp through the list palette so i'm gonna go ahead and make this a little bigger and i'm gonna right mouse click here and i'm going to say custom commands this is where it gets a little interesting so what we need to do is we need to find a command in here that we want to use and it doesn't matter which one it is right so here's my autocad commands these are all the things available through your cui and i'm just going to drag the arc over here and it looks like an autocad arc but i can come in here and i can go to properties and now i can change this to load up one of my list routines because i have some in here and we'll go oh no i want to go the sqm right so this is the command that's going to load i can actually change the image here should give me a chance to do that right so i'm going to come in here to properties and i want i'll change this to design layers right i'll change this this and i'll go okay here and then now i can specify a different image so i would go find a different image and now when i launch this it's going to launch my square meter my design layers and it populates this from a lisp routine obviously this is no different than running it from a menu so if i come in here i can go to my properties and this is where i can set control c control c and then i can run the if statement um i can come in here and say load a specific lisp routine and then run the command i'm hoping that's what you're looking for david that is how we normally load list routines through this if you have a pull down menu or you have a ribbon tab you can click and drag them from the ribbon right in there how would you load a spec sheet created in word or excel from the palette that is a good question david really that's going to come down to how do you normally do it if you're inserting word or excel and you're using an olay you would probably need to continue to use that process if you're using olay if you're using a data extraction or not data extraction if you're linking to an excel spreadsheet you would still need to go through that process there's not a way to shortcut it here this is primarily meant for blocks and commands and some of the other things word and excel it constitutes more advanced functionality where you actually have to go through the picks and clicks all right so let's come back here so if i insert this block you're going to see that that's right and i inserted it's on this zero p line layer but what we're going to do now is we're going to come in here to properties and i'm going to change which layer it comes on right so if i put this on this layer now when i insert it it comes on a different layer the pax cabins if i come to a brand new drawing right and you're going to see i have no layers in here when i click on this and bring it in oops that one you're gonna see it automatically added that pax cabin layer so this is a great way can we run an old school bat file under command to copy large numbers of files or sync large numbers of files john you probably could do that that would be a little more complex programming you could if you can run that through a lisp you can load the lisp in here where you open up the shell from lisp and then you run your batch file or you run the command there where it'll open up the the shell the command shell in order to run something from the command or from a command prompt you could do that so that's really all about this and if we talk about we come back here right here's my properties here obviously we have door size so i can specify which door size i want to be my default right so if i say this is a closed and you'll see my image updated here to the closed door and now when i insert its closed door how does the new drawing know the layer properties color line weight etc that is an excellent question jessica when you set it up here this information in here and i can look at the properties it hard codes this information into the palette so inside the palette itself um and actually let's let's talk about this since we now have this percent app these are excellent questions by the way all right r22 enu support tool palettes palette right here's my webinar tool palette now i'm going to show you this a little later but i'm going to i'm going to get a little more into this so we can actually go in here and open this with just generic notepad this is how i normally open this so if we come in here and i look for control f and i go pa x and i find next as part of that right here what it's going to do is that when you insert that value it is going to create this zero packs cabin information and there's a label table record is not plotted as false line weight is minus three symbol table record packs cabins basically what it's doing is it is going to create that layer on the fly from here can the block be brought in from design center uh beru hang on that's one of my bonus ones that we're going to talk about in the uh timothy what's the best way to share tool paths with others in my team welcome timothy haven't talked to you in a long time um we are going to cover that toward the end on how to share it i just wanted to cover the basics here so that everyone can see exactly how we go through and create our tool palettes so that's just the brief demonstration right here so now let's talk about sharing good segue timothy good segue so to share custom tool palettes to another user you simply right mouse click on the sidebar select customize palettes right mouse click on the palette you've created and select export save the file and share that to another user to import they return to the customized palettes right mouse click and select import browse to the file and import the new palette okay this is sharing to a single user this is the best way to do it now if you have palette groups as well you need to export the palettes and the palette groups both so this will create an xtp file for the palettes and then xpg for palette groups when importing you always want to import all the palettes first which are the xtgs or sorry yep xtgs and then xtp okay i gotta fix that and then once all of these are imported then import the xpg which is the palette group and it will correctly find all the palettes here and create that group um is there a way to open a pdf from a tool palette like if i wanted to link our cad standards pdf to the tool palette for an easy reference yes there is a way to do that um there is a command um there's a specific shell where you want to do a more or less a file open pdf where you're opening shell that's a little more complicated but brett it can be done where it'll basically open up a pdf and open up your default pdf reader so let's get back to sharing let me get back to my autocad where did i hide that right so now we have this new webinar one i'm going to right mouse click and i'm going to go to customize palettes right oh i forgot what i didn't show you is that we're going to go ahead and we're going to create a new group right and i'm going to drag this group up to here that's a new group and then i'm going to grab my webinar right here so there's my new group so the first thing i would do is i would go ahead and export this all right now we'll stick the xtp in there and then my new group and i'm going to export that xpg stick that in my webinar perfect so then i would close this and in fact we can turn around and open up a different version of autocad to show you the import process uh you've had issues trying to import pallets with custom hatches and the hatches don't come with is that normal it is normal if the user that's trying to import it does not have the pat files on their machine and locatable because what it references when you are bringing crossed hatches is that it references the pattern file or the dot p-a-t and if that's not there it will not bring across that tool palette so that would usually be the first thing i would want to look at right so we're here and i'm going to go to customize palettes first thing i'm going to do is right mouse click and i'm going to import why did it not create my here's my webinar xtp all right there's my webinar xtp and then i'm going to import my pallet group and it should have created my new group here and it should have brought that over and it did not and i'm not sure why but normally it would have brought this new group in and would have brought my palette with the webinar palette here so if i want to look at just the new group the only thing it's going to show me is that webinar palette all right if the custom tool palettes and groups are saved in the same folder as the default ones where they load automatically instead of inserting this blocks can the tool palettes be inserted as xrefs instead all right insert as block insert as xref that's simple as changing the properties here jb uh jessica if the custom tool palettes and groups are saved in the same folder as the default ones will they load automatically the short answer is maybe long answer is probably not and there's a reason behind that and we're going to cover that so you can change how you insert this hopefully jb that tells you what you need to know about that so that's how we do the simple process now we're going to go into more of the complex pieces of this so sharing tool palettes across multiple users without having to use the import and export of xpg or xtp files so all tool palette groups are saved in the local profile aws file which is located here okay you exit autocad on the target computer you copy the profile aws to the same folder overriding the existing file and when autocad has started the tool palette groups will be available when running under the default unnamed profile it is important to note that this profile aws also controls location size and appearance of other dialogues and palettes the user will need to reset those back to their preferred if you choose this option okay what it means is that that profile aws right and i'll show this file to you right under your support folder under profiles you'll see i have a couple in here this is the one i'm currently running as the unnamed profile this profile aws is where all of the pallet groups gets stored okay and that means that this is localized to each individual user if you're using palette groups so what i typically do and there's a process we're going to talk about in just a minute i just want to show you that this profile aws is going to be the bane of your existence for multiple users um in some cases and it's important to know what it is uh when sharing pallets do the blocks on a pallet live in the palette or is it just a pointer it's just a pointer david so if you've got a standards directory that's the best place to point it to so that everybody has access okay users with custom profiles rather than unnamed for autocad only will need to overwrite the profile aws file contained in the appropriate folder as you saw from here i have multiple profiles i'm currently working on here the profile aws file does not include the path to where the actual tool palettes and images are found you specify the file path to the tool palette files that's the atc and options so again we come back into autocad and we're going to talk about the options here right so under files and we come down here to tool palettes this is where i'm currently pointing and let's see let's see so this is where all the tool palettes are stored this is where you can change to a network location um and you can point everyone there so if you want to go that route which can be done um you'll want to make sure oops right so profile aws does not include the path to where the actual tool palettes of the images are fine specify the file path to the tool palette file the atc and options files dialog window copy those from the source machine to the target machine here etc and here is placing tool pallets on a common drive this is the most often one we talk about can tool pallets be run from off sharepoint for multiple users um sean the short answer is yes long answer is yes with some caveats sharepoint is not officially supported by autodesk you may have some errant behaviors and there's another thing that is here right in here which i typically recommend is to create all the pallets and groups first copper the entire folder and icons to your network location point the users to the new location in autocad options and it's best to have this location read-only except for a few people otherwise if someone makes a change in their palette it will affect everyone yes i know david double stress the read-only i cannot tell you this enough is that you have to have your tool palette set read only that location except to one or two people who can make changes because if somebody makes a change to their tool palette and they have right location it will affect all other users who point to that same location um is there a setup for using a replicated drive across multiple offices we haven't been able to get it worked no running dfs or replication is going to be very difficult to get to work um simply because if someone has autocad open and they have the tool pallets open the replication fails and then you get those tool palette or asset was open by so and so tool palettes get created your best bet is if you're going to be doing that to only do that are you able to take custom tool palettes from autocad architecture and copy them to autocad lt yes you can do that however if you are running anything that is architecture specific in autocad it will not run in autocad lt i know that autocad architecture does have some very specific tool catalogs and some other stuff but if it's basic functionality of autocad architecture you should be able to do that what is an easy way to copy text into the command line box in the palette properties box really what i normally do is i open up notepad can the electrical palette go to a t it's their lt it's the same thing if the electrical tool palette or the architecture tool palette is running architecture or electrical specific stuff okay in other words there are specific things that run inside electrical and specific things around the inside of architecture those tool palettes will not work or those commands will not work on the tool palettes but the other stuff normally should can you import more than one palette at a time i generally recommend against that john to only to only do one at a time but i believe you can select multiples not all network locations work well for larger national companies what are your recommendations for this problem um sean that's uh more of a cad standards question but what i would normally recommend in that case is that you copy your tool palettes to the local c drive and you essentially treat them as if they were you have your what's the best way to say this you have your working copy on the network drive you copy that locally via sync for the people who need those tool palettes and then you sync everyone locally to their c drive and that is what i usually recommend in those cases especially a lot of us that have remote users that is going to be the biggest thing that you need to think about is is going that route if you use dropbox to share your tool palette path and blocks makes it faster since files are stored on each computer onedrive can't handle sharing tool pallet paths no onedrive cannot dropbox can do it because dropbox is essentially creating a local copy of that information brett so that does work as well so some things to be aware of when you're placing tool pallets on a common drive if you update the pallets images commands everyone has to be out of autocad before you affect the change if they can write to the tool palette location since autocad will update the palettes on close of autocad so if you have multiple users and you're making changes to the palettes yes m leaders can be put on a pallet it's a command um that's a big one right there is that what i see a lot of people doing is that they're they're making all of their changes to a live network location everyone has the option to read and write to that location they make all their changes they close autocad they reopen somebody closes autocad after they've made changes and all of their stuff is lost that's a big caveat i want to make sure everyone understands and anything you add typically ends up at the bottom of the palettes for under for other users again this is that profile aws and also if you add new groups they will not show up for the users again that's that profile aws so those are some of the common things you all need to understand so when i typically when i get into these conversations um i generally recommend to put all information either on the network if it's a small team or have it have your network copy be the gospel and then have it right to the local machine on a shared folder that's synced every time you log in what's the best fastest way to store blocks individual files or common drawings um honestly sean i'm i'm a big fan if all of your standard information can live in a single drawing where you import all the blocks into a single drawing i like that because now you only have one drawing to keep track of and if you need to make a change you make a change to that one drawing in other situations depending on you know commonality of blocks things like that i might just keep a block or i might point a block pallet back to a directory and you will see slow performance with everything in one depending on how many blocks you put in that one drawing if you're going to do it that way i try to limit it to 10 or 15 blocks per drawing and see if that helps with your performance um and then will changing profiles change palette absolutely um your profile here like this is my unnamed profile you have this tool palette path here this may be a different location in other uh profiles so as long as all of your profiles have the same tool palette location it'll be fine uh can you show us that list file that you use for your design layers um i i can show it to you it's not going to tell you a whole lot basically all it is it's just a quick little lisp code where all i'm doing is creating layers and working data and that's literally all it's doing right there dsqm it's just making sure that it launches the command line layer thaws packs dining make sure that it's not that it's thawed doesn't make creates it or if this already exists with different properties changes all the properties you can't edit list files from a palette you have to do that from either a lisp editor or notepad depending on your level of experience yeah dwt file that's absolutely another webinar topic um on templates you inherited our two i inherited our tool palette so i don't know how it was originally set up but i've noticed i have three tool palette file locations is this something i need to change any issues with this well um i'm a big fan of simple i would probably try and consolidate all that down to a single location which means that you need to rebuild everything so that you have a single location um multiple locations is perfectly fine but if there is a pallet that exists in a and again in your options if you have multiple paths in here it's a hierarchy so everything that starts at the top gets loaded first so this location gets loaded first the next location the next location if you have pallets of the same name you may see both or it may only see the first one that it runs across so keep that in mind wow you guys have some great questions so we're going to talk about some of the bonus items so if you have a server or a location change to the source data you do not need to recreate the tool palettes or repass each one individually how many of you have done this where you've had a change to your drive letter or your server and now you have to literally go back through autocad go to each one of these and go to properties and change this right you're trying too hard so again what we're going to do is we're going to come back to we're going to come back to that profile right so we come back in here back to support go to your registered or go to our tool palettes we're going to go find that tool palette so again i have that webinar tool palette and again all i'm going to do is open this in notepad and i'm gonna go find that path so right so you're gonna see right here i have this path so this is the drawing and the path right here i can now do a control c i can do control h and i can replace this with whatever my new path is and hit replace all okay save and close this make sure autocad is closed when you do this save and close this next time you open up autocad it'll be pointing to all the new places that's the easiest way to do that how do you sync palettes locally from a network drive well that's a good question depending on um if you are copying local what i generally recommend is to work with your it group so that they can set up either a periodic sync or a login sync where you just overwrite whatever is on the user's local machine that's going to be the best way to handle that we have palettes set up on a common drive and when i create new tool palette to share it shows up in the same location as the other atc files but it's not added to the end of the user's tool palettes any ideas what we may be doing wrong okay when you're setting up a new tool palette okay a new tool palette here this catalog atc here again if we open this here in notepad this contains all the palettes right here's my webinar palette if the users are pointed to all the same place where this actp catalog.atc is being updated if you are creating new tool palettes you have to make sure everyone is out of autocad make your changes and then come back in and that might be where the problem is is they're either not pointing to the correct ac tp catalog if they're pointing locally it's not going to pick it up if they're pointing to the common drive they should be picking it up there and those are typically what i find out and that may be something where we need to look at it a little deeper from the technical standpoint um do you think autocad will ever improve the tool palettes feature so it's easier to share tool palettes and palette groups with multi-users um i will tell you right now unless we are squeaking about it to autodesk they are probably not going to put a whole lot of thought process into it there is hang on just a second there is a link i want to share with all of you and that link is hang on let me get to there's a product information link a basically where you can ask autodesk information let me see if i've got it here because i usually do product feedback that's what i want i'm going to put this in here it's in our main chat the product feedback okay if you guys do not if you guys don't put in product feedback to autodesk nothing gets changed so that's what we that's what i tell people is go here put product feedback the more people who complain about something the more likely it is to end up on the radar list to be changed what is the best way to keep the items in the pallets in the order i place them they tend to go to the bottom of the pallets yes um that again follows that whole right that's that profile aws right anything you typically add ends up at the bottom of the pallets for other users this is that profile aws so unless you are replacing the profile aws on those machines the user will have to drag them up to the correct locations one of the things that i tell people when they're implementing tool palettes is try to do everything that you can first and then if you do need to add things later either warn your users that that's going to be at the bottom of the pound they have to drag it up um yep you can do a select all cut and replace and it does reorder it that is a good suggestion sean you go into your palette what he's talking about is you come in here right and i select i can come up here right right and i'm going to hold down the shift key grab it all cut paste and then it will know what this order is that is an excellent one sean i i haven't done that one in a while usually i go i'm i'm old school so i'll actually go back into the at i'll actually go into the atc code here and reorder it in notepad and do it that way but that is a very good suggestion that's the that's the easy button then you drop a new block from the drawing onto a palette absolutely i can drop things there um hang on just a second we're gonna get there right and if you have a drawing with all of your standard blocks inserted you can use design center to create a palette from that drawing my issue is one of my palettes always comes up in the wrong location and i have to move it wrong location on your screen or wrong location in the sort order on the side sean sort order yeah that's going to be your tool palette group most likely is controlling that so that may need to be changed um so this is where you can use design center to create a palette from that drawing you can also create a new palette from a directory so you don't have to do it all individually come back in here i'll open up design center right and i have my webinar here's my electrical it's just a bunch these i'll right mouse click and i will say create a tool palette of blocks can you make a sheet set in a palette no you cannot make a sheet set in a palette sheet sets are their own separate animal and pallets don't support it so all i did here was make this electrical directory and now i have all of those drawings in here and now i can make my changes now in my lighting directory here i have one drawing that's my lighting standard that has a bunch of blocks in it i can right mouse click on this and i i can right mouse click on this and i can create a tool palette from that drawing once this is done now i have all of the blocks that are in this drawing here this lighting drawing are now in their own separate palette here all right that that's all i had to show you what other questions do you guys have you",
